Gerard O'Donovan reviews The Fantastic Mr Feynman

A documentary exploring the life and career of noted physicist Richard Feynmann.

4 out of 5 stars

Richard Feynman, whose diagrams provided the first intuitive way of drawing particle interactions 
By Gerard O'Donovan10:30PM BST 12 May 2013CommentsComments
Recently I watched The Challenger, an engrossing BBC Two drama starring William Hurt as a scientist battling terminal illness and deliberate obfuscation to get at the truth behind the 1986 space shuttle disaster. Beautifully crafted, it revealed as much about the indefatigable spirit of the physicist Richard Feynman as it did of his discovery that shockingly basic engineering failings had caused the disaster. It was aired again ahead of The Fantastic Mr Feynman (BBC Two, Sunday), an absorbing documentary that burrowed deep into the life of “one of the most extraordinary scientists of the 20th century”.
This was biography in the heroic mould, an unalloyed celebration of a man whose maverick tendencies affected everything he did in life (he died in 1988), from his wartime work on the A-bomb, to the problem solving that won him the Nobel Prize for his work in quantum electrodynamics. But the film also revealed a restless spirit who was as uncomfortable with his Nobel prize (“I don’t believe in honours, honours bother me”) as he was with knowing that his wartime work had contributed to tens of thousands of deaths.
At root were emotional factors: an adored father who instilled a dyed-in-the-wool contempt for authority; and an adored first wife, Arlene, lost to tuberculosis at 26. Factors that tempered his remarkable mathematical gifts with a broad streak of humanity and a sense of life’s uncertainty.
Feynman’s impish charm and bubbling-over desire to share his inexhaustible scientific wonder crackled off the screen. “He discovered a new law of nature; only very few people did that,” said his son Carl with pride. More likely though it is Feynman’s still rarer skills as a communicator of science – living on in the internet age through countless YouTube tributes and his enduringly popular books – that will keep his place secure among the greats.","['Feynman', 'BBC', 'Physics']",Sebastiaan Deerenberg

📖 Video summary:

If you've learned some quantum mechanics before, you've probably seen it described using wavefunctions, and the Schrödinger equation, and so on. That's how quantum mechanics was originally constructed by people like Schrödinger, Born, Heisenberg, and many others in the 1920s.

In the 1940s, though, a 20-something-year-old grad student named Richard Feynman discovered another approach. He found that the motion of a quantum particle can be described by taking a sum over ALL the possible trajectories that the particle could conceivably follow. That sum over all quantum paths is what's nowadays called the Feynman path integral, and it's central to our modern understanding of quantum physics.

One of the most important lessons Feynman's perspective reveals is how the usual laws of classical mechanics emerge from this more fundamental, but seemingly very different, quantum mechanical description of nature. In the video, you'll see why a single, special path emerges from the sea of all possible quantum paths when we consider the motion of a big object like a baseball--called the path of stationary action. And that of course is the path that obeys F = ma!

His third wife, Gweneth Howarth, was a native of West Yorkshire, so every year the Feynman family would visit her hometown of Ripponden or the nearby hamlet of Mill Bank.

The resulting film, Take the World From Another Point of View, was broadcast in America as part of the PBS Nova series. The documentary features a fascinating interview, but what sets it apart from other films on Feynman is the inclusion of a lively conversation he had with the eminent British astrophysicist Fred Hoyle.","['Another', 'World', 'Some', 'Richard Feynman (Academic)', 'Documentary (TV Genre)', 'Physics (Field Of Study)', 'Physicist (Profession)', 'Nobel Lauriet', 'Nobel Prize (Award)', 'Interview', 'High-definition Television (Accommodation Feature)']",mrtp

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was an American  physicist  known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics (he proposed the parton model).

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world.

He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb and was a member of the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing, and introducing the concept of nanotechnology (creation of devices at the molecular scale). He held the Richard Chace Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, notably a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"" and ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books (""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" and ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"") and books written about him, such as ""Tuva or Bust!""

He was regarded as an eccentric and free spirit. He was a prankster, juggler, safecracker, proud amateur painter, and bongo player. He liked to pursue a variety of seemingly unrelated interests, such as art, percussion, Maya hieroglyphs, and lock picking.

Feynman also had a deep interest in biology, and was a friend of the geneticist and microbiologist Esther Lederberg, who developed replica plating and discovered bacteriophage lambda. They had several mutual physicist friends who, after beginning their careers in nuclear research, moved for moral reasons into genetics, among them Leó Szilárd, Guido Pontecorvo, and Aaron Novick.

► Speaker: Richard Feynman

He was Research Assistant at Princeton (1940-1941), Professor of Theoretical Physics at Cornell University (1945-1950), Visiting Professor and thereafter appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology (1950-1959). At present he is Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology. Feynman remade quantum electrodynamics—the theory of the interaction between light and matter—and thus altered the way science understands the nature of waves and particles. He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for this work, which tied together in an experimentally perfect package all the varied phenomena at work in light, radio, electricity, and magnetism.

A 40 minute audio recording, restored with visual aids and diagrams, given by the legendary physicist and educator Richard Feynman on the history and development of the search for the fundamental structure of matter, from atomic physics to elementary particle physics. 

I personally restored this audio and produced the video for anyone with an interest, or even just a mild curiosity, in the world of particle physics and what scientific discoveries has happened, and continues to happen, at particle accelerator facilities such as at Fermilab, SLAC and of course CERN. This is a good lecture for anyone who wants a relatively quick but concise lecture from one of the grand masters of the field of physics. 

The story of how humanity's knowledge of matter, from the Periodic Table to the Standard Model of Particle Physics, developed is a very interesting one and shows that once we think we have found simplicity in physics, more complicated and unexpected phenomena and patterns occur again at a deeper level as nature does not give up its secrets so easily and never seems to let us get too complacent in our assumed mastery of a particular field. This has of course generated more and more discoveries and technological breakthroughs in their wake, accelerating our knowledge of matter and energy and increasing our power to manipulate it.","['Richard Feynman (Academic)', 'Particle Physics (Field Of Study)', 'Physics (Field Of Study)', 'Quantum Mechanics (Field Of Study)', 'Quantum Theory', 'Science', 'Program', 'Documentary (TV Genre)', 'Lecture', 'Elementary Particle', 'Atomic Physics (Field Of Study)', 'Story']",Muon Ray

The 1986 Dirac Memorial Lectures

Developing a theory that seamlessly combines relativity and quantum mechanics, the most important conceptual breakthroughs in twentieth century physics, has proved to be a difficult and ongoing challenge. This book details how two distinguished physicists and Nobel laureates have explored this theme in two lectures given in Cambridge, England, in 1986 to commemorate the famous British physicist Paul Dirac. Given for nonspecialists and undergraduates, the talks transcribed in Elementary Particles and the Laws of Physics focus on the fundamental problems of physics and the present state of our knowledge. Professor Feynman examines the nature of antiparticles, and in particular the relationship between quantum spin and statistics. Professor Weinberg speculates on how Einstein's theory of gravitation might be reconciled with quantum theory in the final law of physics. Highly accessible, deeply thought provoking, this book will appeal to all those interested in the development of modern physics.","['physics', 'paul', 'dirac', 'paul dirac', 'richard feynman', 'feynman', 'lecture', 'elementary', 'particle', 'laws', 'memorial', '1986', 'antiparticles', 'particle physics', 'theory', 'cambridge', 'university']",mrtp

If you find any topic difficult to understand, apply the Feynman technique. And not only science, you can apply Feynman Technique to understand topics from any subject.

The 4 steps of The Feynman Technique:
Step 1. Choose a Topic and study
Step 2. Write everything you know on blank page
Step 3. Study again to understand the Gap
Step 4. Simplify and Refine

Richard P. Feynman was a Nobel Prize winning physicist who made significant contributions in areas such as quantum mechanics and particle physics and also well known for his ability to understand and explain difficult Mathematical and Physics concepts in very easy language. He was also known as ""The Great Explainer"" because of his amazing explaining ability.

Previous Episode:
The First Quantum Field Theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATcrrzJFtBY

There is a fundamental limit to the knowability of the universe. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that the more precisely we try to define one property, the less definable is its counterpart. Knowing a particle’s location perfectly means its velocity is unknowable. But  unmeasured properties are not just uncertain; they are undefined. Quantum mechanics seems to imply that ALL possible properties, paths, or events that could reasonably occur between measurements DO occur. Whether or not this is true, a mathematical description of this crazy idea led to the most powerful expression of quantum mechanics ever devised: Richard Feynman’s path integral formulation.

Những năm giữa của thế kỉ 20 là thời đại vàng son của những nhà khoa học xuất chúng khi họ đã có nhiều những phát minh thay đổi nhân loại, trong số đó không thể không kể đến nhà vật lý lý thuyết Richard Phillips Feynman. Trong cuộc đời của mình, Feynman đã có đóng góp lớn vào ngành vật lý thế giới và từng đạt giải Nobel Vật Lý vào năm 1965. Không những vậy, ông còn là một con người chính trực, thẳng thắn phê phán những hội đồng “quan liêu” dù những nơi ấy mang lại cho ông rất nhiều lợi ích.

Richard Phillips Feynman (Queens, Nueva York; 11 de mayo de 1918-Los Ángeles, California; 15 de febrero de 1988) fue un físico teórico estadounidense2​3​4​ conocido por sus trabajos en la formulación por integrales de camino en la mecánica cuántica, la teoría de la electrodinámica cuántica y la física de la superfluidez del helio líquido subenfriado, así como en la física de partículas, campo en el que propuso el modelo Partón. Por sus contribuciones al desarrollo de la electrodinámica cuántica, Feynman, junto con Julian Schwinger y Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, recibió el Premio Nobel de Física en 1965.

Desarrolló un conjunto de esquemas de representación pictórica ampliamente utilizados para las expresiones matemáticas que rigen el comportamiento de las partículas subatómicas, que más tarde se conocieron como los diagramas de Feynman. Durante su vida, Feynman se convirtió en uno de los científicos más conocidos en el mundo. En una encuesta de 1999 de la revista británica Physics World, de los 130 principales físicos de todo el mundo citados, Feynman fue clasificado como uno de los diez más grandes físicos de todos los tiempos.

71,Técnica Feynman - Como aprender qualquer coisa segundo o físico Richard Feynman,2861145,178333,0,1890,2017-09-02T14:56:11Z,265.0,pt,"Você sabia que existem algumas técnicas para ajudar a acelerar o aprendizado? Com elas, é possível aprender qualquer assunto de forma mais rápida e eficaz. Uma delas é a Técnica Feynman.

Richard Feynman foi um físico norte-americano do século XX. Ao apresentar os conceitos da eletrodinâmica quântica, ele recebeu o Prêmio Nobel de Física em 1965.

Além de todas as suas contribuições para a Física, Feynman era muito admirado pela sua capacidade de aprender e ensinar assuntos complexos de forma rápida e eficiente. Dizem que o físico costumava ir no Departamento de Matemática e desafiava  qualquer um que lá estivesse à explicar-lhe um assunto qualquer de sua especialidade. Ele dizia que não importava qual assunto fosse e por mais difícil que parecesse, ele aprenderia desde que tudo fosse explicado com palavras simples.

Foi dessa habilidade que foi criada a Técnica Feynman, que pode ser aplicada para diversos assuntos, e é indicada para quem deseja aprender algo de forma rápida e mais eficaz. Muitas pessoas utilizam essa técnica para aprender algum assunto novo em pouco tempo, aperfeiçoar o que já sabe, ou até para estudar para alguma prova ou concurso.

Benefícios da Técnica Feynman:

-Aprender um novo assunto
-Memorizar ideias que você até entende, mas tem dificuldade de gravar
-Ajudar a entender ideias nas quais você tem dificuldade em compreender

Como funciona?

São 5 etapas para aplicar a técnica:

1 - Escolha e pesquise sobre o assunto

O primeiro passo é o básico: escolher o assunto que você deseja ou precisa aprender. Pesquise tudo o que puder sobre o assunto e selecione todo o material disponível. Livros e sites são ótimas opções! Comece a estudar o assunto normalmente, e depois siga para o próximo passo.

2 - Explicar o assunto

Você deverá pegar uma folha de papel e começar a escrever sobre o assunto que está estudando. Escreva como se estivesse explicando sobre o assunto para outra pessoa. Se imagine como um professor, dando aula para outra pessoa, porém de uma forma simples, utilizando palavras facéis.

Escrever ajuda na memorização, por isso é indicado utilizar uma folha e anotar todo o seu conhecimento.

3 - Escreva e fale em voz alta

Enquanto você está escrevendo sobre o assunto, aproveite para falar em voz alta, como se realmente estivesse explicando para alguém. Como falamos acima, imite um professor e finja que está tentando explicar o assunto para outra pessoa. Lembre-se que é fundamental explicar de maneira simplificada para que a ""outra pessoa"" - que na verdade é você - aprenda mais rápido. Ao falar em voz alta, você irá memorizar mais facilmente.

4 - Dominando o assunto

Neste passo você irá fazer uma análise do que conseguiu aprender e memorizar, e o que ainda falta melhorar. Você deve estudar novamente os assuntos que ainda não estão bem entendidos. Estude o assunto até que você o domine completamente. Se for necessário, repita o procedimento até que você tenha entendido tudo. Não se pressione, pois o fundamental é dominar o assunto.

5 - Simplifique o conteúdo

O último passo é simplificar o conteúdo. Ou seja, faça um resumo e anote tudo o que for mais importante, escrevendo e falando de uma maneira bem compreensível. Utilize palavras simples, pois o objetivo é entender o assunto e memorizar.

Se você perceber que ainda não entendeu o assunto, é porque está escrevendo e explicando de forma muito complexa. Você irá compreender profundamente o assunto, quando conseguir explicá-lo de forma simples, clara e objetiva. Este é o segredo da Técnica Feynman para aprender e memorizar de forma mais rápida.","['Richard Feynman', 'Feynman', 'Técnica Feynman', 'Aprenda qualquer coisa', 'Aprendizagem acelerada', 'Técnicas de aprendizagem', 'Físico Richard Feynman', 'como estudar para o enem', 'como estudar para concurso', 'estudar', 'como memorizar', 'técnica feynman de estudos', 'memorizar', 'memorização', 'enem', 'métodos de estudo', 'como estudar', 'técnicas de estudo', 'como estudar melhor', 'como aprender', 'como estudar para prova', 'como estudar sozinho', 'como aprender qualquer coisa dificil', 'como aprender mais rápido']",Life Pins

The Feynman (pronounced ""Fine-man"") technique has changed my life. Reviewing all the study methods I've ever used, this technique easily secures a place as one of my top five study methods. The basics of the technique are that you try to explain a complicated topic in simplified terms, allowing you to better understand the complex topic. Pretty simple right? I thought so. The only problem is that my grades went down when I first started using it, and my time spent studying went up; what was I doing wrong?

How Idea of QUANTUM COMPUTERS was Born? What was Richard Feynman's role in Quantum Computers? EXPLAINED by AyushKaari in Hindi. 

What can Quantum Computers do that even Supercomputers can’t do? The first answer is Simulation. In 1981 Prof Richard Feynman delivered his famous speech - Simulating Physics With Computers. This speed was published in the International Journal of Theoretical Physics a year later(1982). And this is how the idea of Quantum Computers took off. 
What is Simulation? Why Simulating Physics is hard with even the most powerful supercomputers? And How can we use a different kinds of Computers to simulate nature? The answer involves the complexity and quantum nature of stuff at the smallest level. We’re trying to discuss all of these ideas & concepts in this video. 

साल 1981 की बात है. एक फिज़िसिस्ट कंप्यूटर्स से एक काम को लेकर परेशान था. उन्होंने कई कंप्यूटर साइंटिस्ट और भौतिक-शास्त्रियों के सामने ये बात रखी. साथ में ये भी बात रखी कि कैसे इस परेशानी का इलाज निकाला जा सकता है. नतीजा ये निकला कि इस फिज़िसिस्ट की स्पीच से एक नए किस्म के कंप्यूटर्स का उदय हुआ. इन कंप्यूटर्स को हम क्वांटम कंप्यूटर्स कहते हैं. जानिए पूरी कहानी इस वीडियो में.

ABOUT  

Ayush Yadav graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2019. After graduation, he started working with The Lallantop. Lallantop’s Editor Saurabh Dwivedi appointed him the Science Editor of Lallantop. Ayush used to host a weekly Science Show on Lallantop - Sciencekaari. 

आयुष यादव नामक बालक 2019 में IIT गुवाहाटी से ग्रैजुएट हुआ. जैसे-तैसे हो गया समझो. उसके बाद इसने दी लल्लनटॉप के साथ लेख जोतना शुरू किया. संपादक सौरभ द्विवेदी की दया, करूणा और असीम प्रेम ने आयुष को लल्लनटॉप का साइंस एडिटर बना दिया. भाई का अपना एक वीकली शो आता था. साइंसकारी. उसमें ये साइंस समझाता पाया जाता था. फिर आयुष ने ये चैनल बना लिया, और यहां साइंस समझाने लगा. इसके अलावा आयुष ने कुछ खास नहीं उखाड़ा. अभी जोतने में लगा है. जब टाइम आएगा तो कलेबा करके उखाड़ने पहुंच जाएगा. 
आयुष एक नंबर का घुमक्कड़, इंट्रोवर्ट और निर्लज्ज प्राणी है. इसको कुछ भी सीखने में बहुत आनंद आता है. लेकिन याद्दाश्त का कच्चा है बेचारा. सो दूसरों को पढ़ाकर सीखा हुआ समेटने की कोशिश करता रहता है.","['idea of quantum computers', 'feynman quantum computer', 'richard feynman quantum', 'first quantum computer', 'simulating physics with computers', 'feynman simulation', 'simulation with computers', 'ayushkari', 'ayush lallantop', 'lallantop sciencekaari', 'sciencekaari', 'inventor of quantum computer', 'computer simulation', 'quantum computer in hindi', 'quantum computing upsc', 'quantum computing', 'invention of quantum computer', 'history of quantum computer', 'quantum simulation', 'quantum computer', 'supercomputer']",AyushKaari

99,Richard Feynman : Nobel Genius who solved the Challenger Mystery,1010,31,0,9,2023-08-13T16:08:23Z,319.0,en,"On that fateful morning of January 28, 1986, millions around the globe witnessed one of the most heart-wrenching tragedies in the history of space exploration—the Challenger Space Shuttle's devastating explosion merely 73 seconds after its launch. This catastrophic event beckoned for clarity and a rigorous inquiry. Enter Richard Feynman—a Nobel laureate physicist with a reputation for genius and eccentricity.

Many remember Feynman from his silver screen portrayal in the Oppenheimer biopic—a quirky physicist playing pranks in the covert world of the Manhattan Project. But beyond the cinematic narrative, in the secretive chambers of Los Alamos, Feynman played a pivotal role in constructing the first atomic bomb, a testament to his invaluable contributions to the world of physics.

In the wake of the Challenger disaster, the U.S. administration, under President Reagan, was under immense pressure. An immediate investigation was commissioned, entrusted to the likes of renowned individuals: Astronaut Neil Armstrong, Astrophysicist Sally Ride, ace pilot Chuck Yeager, and Richard Feynman. Yet, amidst this collective brilliance, a discreet caveat was whispered, emphasizing the preservation of NASA's storied legacy.

Amidst this charged environment, Feynman's vibrant intellect and indomitable spirit emerged. He wasn't one to be bogged down by bureaucracy or politics. His mission was unequivocal: unearth the unadulterated truth. His investigations took him through a maze of technical documents, enlightening chats with engineers over coffee, and secret late-night experiments, culminating in discovering the O-ring's vulnerability in colder temperatures.

Feynman's illuminating demonstration during a public hearing symbolized his commitment to scientific truth, reminding us of his pivotal days at Los Alamos. His subsequent reflections on the event underscored the quintessential Feynman philosophy: ""For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.""

Yet, Richard Feynman was much more than his accolades or groundbreaking discoveries. He embodied the spirit of a storyteller, an educator, and an individual whose zest for uncovering the universe's secrets was infectious. He once mused the journey from an ordinary individual to a scientist—a path paved with dedication, passion, and an unyielding quest for knowledge.

As you immerse yourself in this video, remember Richard Feynman as a physicist and a beacon of insatiable curiosity. As Feynman poignantly stated, ""The pleasure of finding things out"" was his most profound joy—a joy he eagerly wanted to share with the world. We hope to share a fragment of that joy with you through this narrative.
