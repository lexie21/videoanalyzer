Gerard O'Donovan reviews The Fantastic Mr Feynman

A documentary exploring the life and career of noted physicist Richard Feynmann.

4 out of 5 stars

Richard Feynman, whose diagrams provided the first intuitive way of drawing particle interactions 
By Gerard O'Donovan10:30PM BST 12 May 2013CommentsComments
Recently I watched The Challenger, an engrossing BBC Two drama starring William Hurt as a scientist battling terminal illness and deliberate obfuscation to get at the truth behind the 1986 space shuttle disaster. Beautifully crafted, it revealed as much about the indefatigable spirit of the physicist Richard Feynman as it did of his discovery that shockingly basic engineering failings had caused the disaster. It was aired again ahead of The Fantastic Mr Feynman (BBC Two, Sunday), an absorbing documentary that burrowed deep into the life of “one of the most extraordinary scientists of the 20th century”.
This was biography in the heroic mould, an unalloyed celebration of a man whose maverick tendencies affected everything he did in life (he died in 1988), from his wartime work on the A-bomb, to the problem solving that won him the Nobel Prize for his work in quantum electrodynamics. But the film also revealed a restless spirit who was as uncomfortable with his Nobel prize (“I don’t believe in honours, honours bother me”) as he was with knowing that his wartime work had contributed to tens of thousands of deaths.
At root were emotional factors: an adored father who instilled a dyed-in-the-wool contempt for authority; and an adored first wife, Arlene, lost to tuberculosis at 26. Factors that tempered his remarkable mathematical gifts with a broad streak of humanity and a sense of life’s uncertainty.
Feynman’s impish charm and bubbling-over desire to share his inexhaustible scientific wonder crackled off the screen. “He discovered a new law of nature; only very few people did that,” said his son Carl with pride. More likely though it is Feynman’s still rarer skills as a communicator of science – living on in the internet age through countless YouTube tributes and his enduringly popular books – that will keep his place secure among the greats.","['Feynman', 'BBC', 'Physics']",Sebastiaan Deerenberg

📖 Video summary:

If you've learned some quantum mechanics before, you've probably seen it described using wavefunctions, and the Schrödinger equation, and so on. That's how quantum mechanics was originally constructed by people like Schrödinger, Born, Heisenberg, and many others in the 1920s.

In the 1940s, though, a 20-something-year-old grad student named Richard Feynman discovered another approach. He found that the motion of a quantum particle can be described by taking a sum over ALL the possible trajectories that the particle could conceivably follow. That sum over all quantum paths is what's nowadays called the Feynman path integral, and it's central to our modern understanding of quantum physics.

One of the most important lessons Feynman's perspective reveals is how the usual laws of classical mechanics emerge from this more fundamental, but seemingly very different, quantum mechanical description of nature. In the video, you'll see why a single, special path emerges from the sea of all possible quantum paths when we consider the motion of a big object like a baseball--called the path of stationary action. And that of course is the path that obeys F = ma!

His third wife, Gweneth Howarth, was a native of West Yorkshire, so every year the Feynman family would visit her hometown of Ripponden or the nearby hamlet of Mill Bank.

In 1973 Yorkshire public television made a short film of the Nobel laureate while he was there. The resulting film, Take the World From Another Point of View, was broadcast in America as part of the PBS Nova series. The documentary features a fascinating interview, but what sets it apart from other films on Feynman is the inclusion of a lively conversation he had with the eminent British astrophysicist Fred Hoyle.","['Another', 'World', 'Some', 'Richard Feynman (Academic)', 'Documentary (TV Genre)', 'Physics (Field Of Study)', 'Physicist (Profession)', 'Nobel Lauriet', 'Nobel Prize (Award)', 'Interview', 'High-definition Television (Accommodation Feature)']",mrtp

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was an American  physicist  known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics (he proposed the parton model).

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world.

He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb and was a member of the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing, and introducing the concept of nanotechnology (creation of devices at the molecular scale). He held the Richard Chace Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, notably a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"" and ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books (""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" and ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"") and books written about him, such as ""Tuva or Bust!""

He was regarded as an eccentric and free spirit. He was a prankster, juggler, safecracker, proud amateur painter, and bongo player. He liked to pursue a variety of seemingly unrelated interests, such as art, percussion, Maya hieroglyphs, and lock picking.

Feynman also had a deep interest in biology, and was a friend of the geneticist and microbiologist Esther Lederberg, who developed replica plating and discovered bacteriophage lambda. They had several mutual physicist friends who, after beginning their careers in nuclear research, moved for moral reasons into genetics, among them Leó Szilárd, Guido Pontecorvo, and Aaron Novick.

► Speaker: Richard Feynman

He was Research Assistant at Princeton (1940-1941), Professor of Theoretical Physics at Cornell University (1945-1950), Visiting Professor and thereafter appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology (1950-1959). At present he is Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology. Feynman remade quantum electrodynamics—the theory of the interaction between light and matter—and thus altered the way science understands the nature of waves and particles. He was co-awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1965 for this work, which tied together in an experimentally perfect package all the varied phenomena at work in light, radio, electricity, and magnetism.

A 40 minute audio recording, restored with visual aids and diagrams, given by the legendary physicist and educator Richard Feynman on the history and development of the search for the fundamental structure of matter, from atomic physics to elementary particle physics. 

I personally restored this audio and produced the video for anyone with an interest, or even just a mild curiosity, in the world of particle physics and what scientific discoveries has happened, and continues to happen, at particle accelerator facilities such as at Fermilab, SLAC and of course CERN. This is a good lecture for anyone who wants a relatively quick but concise lecture from one of the grand masters of the field of physics. 

The story of how humanity's knowledge of matter, from the Periodic Table to the Standard Model of Particle Physics, developed is a very interesting one and shows that once we think we have found simplicity in physics, more complicated and unexpected phenomena and patterns occur again at a deeper level as nature does not give up its secrets so easily and never seems to let us get too complacent in our assumed mastery of a particular field. This has of course generated more and more discoveries and technological breakthroughs in their wake, accelerating our knowledge of matter and energy and increasing our power to manipulate it.","['Richard Feynman (Academic)', 'Particle Physics (Field Of Study)', 'Physics (Field Of Study)', 'Quantum Mechanics (Field Of Study)', 'Quantum Theory', 'Science', 'Program', 'Documentary (TV Genre)', 'Lecture', 'Elementary Particle', 'Atomic Physics (Field Of Study)', 'Story']",Muon Ray

The 1986 Dirac Memorial Lectures

Developing a theory that seamlessly combines relativity and quantum mechanics, the most important conceptual breakthroughs in twentieth century physics, has proved to be a difficult and ongoing challenge. This book details how two distinguished physicists and Nobel laureates have explored this theme in two lectures given in Cambridge, England, in 1986 to commemorate the famous British physicist Paul Dirac. Given for nonspecialists and undergraduates, the talks transcribed in Elementary Particles and the Laws of Physics focus on the fundamental problems of physics and the present state of our knowledge. Professor Feynman examines the nature of antiparticles, and in particular the relationship between quantum spin and statistics. Professor Weinberg speculates on how Einstein's theory of gravitation might be reconciled with quantum theory in the final law of physics. Highly accessible, deeply thought provoking, this book will appeal to all those interested in the development of modern physics.","['physics', 'paul', 'dirac', 'paul dirac', 'richard feynman', 'feynman', 'lecture', 'elementary', 'particle', 'laws', 'memorial', '1986', 'antiparticles', 'particle physics', 'theory', 'cambridge', 'university']",mrtp

Previous Episode:
The First Quantum Field Theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATcrrzJFtBY

There is a fundamental limit to the knowability of the universe. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that the more precisely we try to define one property, the less definable is its counterpart. Knowing a particle’s location perfectly means its velocity is unknowable. But  unmeasured properties are not just uncertain; they are undefined. Quantum mechanics seems to imply that ALL possible properties, paths, or events that could reasonably occur between measurements DO occur. Whether or not this is true, a mathematical description of this crazy idea led to the most powerful expression of quantum mechanics ever devised: Richard Feynman’s path integral formulation.

Những năm giữa của thế kỉ 20 là thời đại vàng son của những nhà khoa học xuất chúng khi họ đã có nhiều những phát minh thay đổi nhân loại, trong số đó không thể không kể đến nhà vật lý lý thuyết Richard Phillips Feynman. Trong cuộc đời của mình, Feynman đã có đóng góp lớn vào ngành vật lý thế giới và từng đạt giải Nobel Vật Lý vào năm 1965. Không những vậy, ông còn là một con người chính trực, thẳng thắn phê phán những hội đồng “quan liêu” dù những nơi ấy mang lại cho ông rất nhiều lợi ích.

Richard Phillips Feynman (Queens, Nueva York; 11 de mayo de 1918-Los Ángeles, California; 15 de febrero de 1988) fue un físico teórico estadounidense2​3​4​ conocido por sus trabajos en la formulación por integrales de camino en la mecánica cuántica, la teoría de la electrodinámica cuántica y la física de la superfluidez del helio líquido subenfriado, así como en la física de partículas, campo en el que propuso el modelo Partón. Por sus contribuciones al desarrollo de la electrodinámica cuántica, Feynman, junto con Julian Schwinger y Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, recibió el Premio Nobel de Física en 1965.

Desarrolló un conjunto de esquemas de representación pictórica ampliamente utilizados para las expresiones matemáticas que rigen el comportamiento de las partículas subatómicas, que más tarde se conocieron como los diagramas de Feynman. Durante su vida, Feynman se convirtió en uno de los científicos más conocidos en el mundo. En una encuesta de 1999 de la revista británica Physics World, de los 130 principales físicos de todo el mundo citados, Feynman fue clasificado como uno de los diez más grandes físicos de todos los tiempos.

70,Técnica Feynman - Como aprender qualquer coisa segundo o físico Richard Feynman,2861149,178333,0,1890,2017-09-02T14:56:11Z,265.0,pt,"Você sabia que existem algumas técnicas para ajudar a acelerar o aprendizado? Com elas, é possível aprender qualquer assunto de forma mais rápida e eficaz. Uma delas é a Técnica Feynman.

Richard Feynman foi um físico norte-americano do século XX. Ao apresentar os conceitos da eletrodinâmica quântica, ele recebeu o Prêmio Nobel de Física em 1965.

Além de todas as suas contribuições para a Física, Feynman era muito admirado pela sua capacidade de aprender e ensinar assuntos complexos de forma rápida e eficiente. Dizem que o físico costumava ir no Departamento de Matemática e desafiava  qualquer um que lá estivesse à explicar-lhe um assunto qualquer de sua especialidade. Ele dizia que não importava qual assunto fosse e por mais difícil que parecesse, ele aprenderia desde que tudo fosse explicado com palavras simples.

Foi dessa habilidade que foi criada a Técnica Feynman, que pode ser aplicada para diversos assuntos, e é indicada para quem deseja aprender algo de forma rápida e mais eficaz. Muitas pessoas utilizam essa técnica para aprender algum assunto novo em pouco tempo, aperfeiçoar o que já sabe, ou até para estudar para alguma prova ou concurso.

Benefícios da Técnica Feynman:

-Aprender um novo assunto
-Memorizar ideias que você até entende, mas tem dificuldade de gravar
-Ajudar a entender ideias nas quais você tem dificuldade em compreender

Como funciona?

São 5 etapas para aplicar a técnica:

1 - Escolha e pesquise sobre o assunto

O primeiro passo é o básico: escolher o assunto que você deseja ou precisa aprender. Pesquise tudo o que puder sobre o assunto e selecione todo o material disponível. Livros e sites são ótimas opções! Comece a estudar o assunto normalmente, e depois siga para o próximo passo.

2 - Explicar o assunto

Você deverá pegar uma folha de papel e começar a escrever sobre o assunto que está estudando. Escreva como se estivesse explicando sobre o assunto para outra pessoa. Se imagine como um professor, dando aula para outra pessoa, porém de uma forma simples, utilizando palavras facéis.

Escrever ajuda na memorização, por isso é indicado utilizar uma folha e anotar todo o seu conhecimento.

3 - Escreva e fale em voz alta

Enquanto você está escrevendo sobre o assunto, aproveite para falar em voz alta, como se realmente estivesse explicando para alguém. Como falamos acima, imite um professor e finja que está tentando explicar o assunto para outra pessoa. Lembre-se que é fundamental explicar de maneira simplificada para que a ""outra pessoa"" - que na verdade é você - aprenda mais rápido. Ao falar em voz alta, você irá memorizar mais facilmente.

4 - Dominando o assunto

Neste passo você irá fazer uma análise do que conseguiu aprender e memorizar, e o que ainda falta melhorar. Você deve estudar novamente os assuntos que ainda não estão bem entendidos. Estude o assunto até que você o domine completamente. Se for necessário, repita o procedimento até que você tenha entendido tudo. Não se pressione, pois o fundamental é dominar o assunto.

5 - Simplifique o conteúdo

O último passo é simplificar o conteúdo. Ou seja, faça um resumo e anote tudo o que for mais importante, escrevendo e falando de uma maneira bem compreensível. Utilize palavras simples, pois o objetivo é entender o assunto e memorizar.

Se você perceber que ainda não entendeu o assunto, é porque está escrevendo e explicando de forma muito complexa. Você irá compreender profundamente o assunto, quando conseguir explicá-lo de forma simples, clara e objetiva. Este é o segredo da Técnica Feynman para aprender e memorizar de forma mais rápida.","['Richard Feynman', 'Feynman', 'Técnica Feynman', 'Aprenda qualquer coisa', 'Aprendizagem acelerada', 'Técnicas de aprendizagem', 'Físico Richard Feynman', 'como estudar para o enem', 'como estudar para concurso', 'estudar', 'como memorizar', 'técnica feynman de estudos', 'memorizar', 'memorização', 'enem', 'métodos de estudo', 'como estudar', 'técnicas de estudo', 'como estudar melhor', 'como aprender', 'como estudar para prova', 'como estudar sozinho', 'como aprender qualquer coisa dificil', 'como aprender mais rápido']",Life Pins

The Feynman (pronounced ""Fine-man"") technique has changed my life. Reviewing all the study methods I've ever used, this technique easily secures a place as one of my top five study methods. The basics of the technique are that you try to explain a complicated topic in simplified terms, allowing you to better understand the complex topic. Pretty simple right? I thought so. The only problem is that my grades went down when I first started using it, and my time spent studying went up; what was I doing wrong?

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman was a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965, together with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime and after his death, Feynman became one of the most publicly known scientists in the world.","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Phillips', 'Physics', 'physicist', 'genius', 'quantum', 'mechanics', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'think', 'thought', 'highest', 'form', 'of', 'worship', 'learn', 'learning', 'open', 'mind', 'free', 'thinker', 'insignificant', 'little', 'planet']",nebulajr

How Idea of QUANTUM COMPUTERS was Born? What was Richard Feynman's role in Quantum Computers? EXPLAINED by AyushKaari in Hindi. 

What can Quantum Computers do that even Supercomputers can’t do? The first answer is Simulation. In 1981 Prof Richard Feynman delivered his famous speech - Simulating Physics With Computers. This speed was published in the International Journal of Theoretical Physics a year later(1982). And this is how the idea of Quantum Computers took off. 
What is Simulation? Why Simulating Physics is hard with even the most powerful supercomputers? And How can we use a different kinds of Computers to simulate nature? The answer involves the complexity and quantum nature of stuff at the smallest level. We’re trying to discuss all of these ideas & concepts in this video. 

साल 1981 की बात है. एक फिज़िसिस्ट कंप्यूटर्स से एक काम को लेकर परेशान था. उन्होंने कई कंप्यूटर साइंटिस्ट और भौतिक-शास्त्रियों के सामने ये बात रखी. साथ में ये भी बात रखी कि कैसे इस परेशानी का इलाज निकाला जा सकता है. नतीजा ये निकला कि इस फिज़िसिस्ट की स्पीच से एक नए किस्म के कंप्यूटर्स का उदय हुआ. इन कंप्यूटर्स को हम क्वांटम कंप्यूटर्स कहते हैं. जानिए पूरी कहानी इस वीडियो में.

ABOUT  

Ayush Yadav graduated from IIT Guwahati in 2019. After graduation, he started working with The Lallantop. Lallantop’s Editor Saurabh Dwivedi appointed him the Science Editor of Lallantop. Ayush used to host a weekly Science Show on Lallantop - Sciencekaari. 

आयुष यादव नामक बालक 2019 में IIT गुवाहाटी से ग्रैजुएट हुआ. जैसे-तैसे हो गया समझो. उसके बाद इसने दी लल्लनटॉप के साथ लेख जोतना शुरू किया. संपादक सौरभ द्विवेदी की दया, करूणा और असीम प्रेम ने आयुष को लल्लनटॉप का साइंस एडिटर बना दिया. भाई का अपना एक वीकली शो आता था. साइंसकारी. उसमें ये साइंस समझाता पाया जाता था. फिर आयुष ने ये चैनल बना लिया, और यहां साइंस समझाने लगा. इसके अलावा आयुष ने कुछ खास नहीं उखाड़ा. अभी जोतने में लगा है. जब टाइम आएगा तो कलेबा करके उखाड़ने पहुंच जाएगा. 
आयुष एक नंबर का घुमक्कड़, इंट्रोवर्ट और निर्लज्ज प्राणी है. इसको कुछ भी सीखने में बहुत आनंद आता है. लेकिन याद्दाश्त का कच्चा है बेचारा. सो दूसरों को पढ़ाकर सीखा हुआ समेटने की कोशिश करता रहता है.","['idea of quantum computers', 'feynman quantum computer', 'richard feynman quantum', 'first quantum computer', 'simulating physics with computers', 'feynman simulation', 'simulation with computers', 'ayushkari', 'ayush lallantop', 'lallantop sciencekaari', 'sciencekaari', 'inventor of quantum computer', 'computer simulation', 'quantum computer in hindi', 'quantum computing upsc', 'quantum computing', 'invention of quantum computer', 'history of quantum computer', 'quantum simulation', 'quantum computer', 'supercomputer']",AyushKaari

95,Richard Feynman : Nobel Genius who solved the Challenger Mystery,1010,31,0,9,2023-08-13T16:08:23Z,319.0,en,"On that fateful morning of January 28, 1986, millions around the globe witnessed one of the most heart-wrenching tragedies in the history of space exploration—the Challenger Space Shuttle's devastating explosion merely 73 seconds after its launch. This catastrophic event beckoned for clarity and a rigorous inquiry. Enter Richard Feynman—a Nobel laureate physicist with a reputation for genius and eccentricity.

Many remember Feynman from his silver screen portrayal in the Oppenheimer biopic—a quirky physicist playing pranks in the covert world of the Manhattan Project. But beyond the cinematic narrative, in the secretive chambers of Los Alamos, Feynman played a pivotal role in constructing the first atomic bomb, a testament to his invaluable contributions to the world of physics.

In the wake of the Challenger disaster, the U.S. administration, under President Reagan, was under immense pressure. An immediate investigation was commissioned, entrusted to the likes of renowned individuals: Astronaut Neil Armstrong, Astrophysicist Sally Ride, ace pilot Chuck Yeager, and Richard Feynman. Yet, amidst this collective brilliance, a discreet caveat was whispered, emphasizing the preservation of NASA's storied legacy.

Amidst this charged environment, Feynman's vibrant intellect and indomitable spirit emerged. He wasn't one to be bogged down by bureaucracy or politics. His mission was unequivocal: unearth the unadulterated truth. His investigations took him through a maze of technical documents, enlightening chats with engineers over coffee, and secret late-night experiments, culminating in discovering the O-ring's vulnerability in colder temperatures.

Feynman's illuminating demonstration during a public hearing symbolized his commitment to scientific truth, reminding us of his pivotal days at Los Alamos. His subsequent reflections on the event underscored the quintessential Feynman philosophy: ""For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.""

Yet, Richard Feynman was much more than his accolades or groundbreaking discoveries. He embodied the spirit of a storyteller, an educator, and an individual whose zest for uncovering the universe's secrets was infectious. He once mused the journey from an ordinary individual to a scientist—a path paved with dedication, passion, and an unyielding quest for knowledge.

As you immerse yourself in this video, remember Richard Feynman as a physicist and a beacon of insatiable curiosity. As Feynman poignantly stated, ""The pleasure of finding things out"" was his most profound joy—a joy he eagerly wanted to share with the world. We hope to share a fragment of that joy with you through this narrative.

Introduction Article to Heuristics and Metaheuristics: http://muonray.blogspot.ie/2016/04/meta-heuristics-and-universal-power-law.html
Richard Feynman, Winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics, gives us an insightful lecture about computer heuristics: how computers work, how they file information, how they handle data, how they use their information in allocated processing in a finite amount of time to solve problems and how they actually compute values of interest to human beings. These topics are essential in the study of what processes reduce the amount of work done in solving a particular problem in computers, giving them speeds of solving problems that can outmatch humans in certain fields but which have not yet reached the complexity of human driven intelligence. The question if human thought is a series of fixed processes that could be, in principle, imitated by a computer is a major theme of this lecture and, in Feynman's trademark style of teaching, gives us clear and yet very powerful answers for this field which has gone on to consume so much of our lives today. 

No doubt this lecture will be of crucial interest to anyone who has ever wondered about the process of human or machine thinking and if a synthesis between the two can be made without violating logic.","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Computer', 'Science', 'Lecture', 'Heuristics', 'Quantum', 'Electrodynamics', 'Math', 'Technology', 'Electronics', 'Physics', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'Computers Inside and Out']",Muon Ray

No vídeo de hoje vamos trocar uma ideia sobre o grande físico Richard Feynman, e a situação na qual ele quis recusar o prêmio Nobel de física.

Richard Philips Feynman foi um físico teórico norte-americano do século XX, foi um dos pioneiros da eletrodinâmica quântica e ficou conhecido pelos seus trabalhos no ramo da formulação integral da mecânica quântica. Pelas suas contribuições para o desenvolvimento da eletrodinâmica quântica, Feynman recebeu o Nobel de Física em 1965 junto ao Julian Schwinger e Shin'ichiro Tomonaga.
Vamos aproveitar a deixa para conversar um pouco sobre a motivação para estudar!

Aquí su técnica única para aprender nuevos materiales:

Paso 1. Elige un tema que desees comprender y comienza a estudiarlo. Una vez que sepas de qué se trata, toma una hoja de papel y escribe el tema en la parte superior de la página.

Paso 2. Imagina que le estás enseñando la idea a otra persona. Escribe una explicación en papel mientras la describe en voz alta. De esta forma, te haces una idea de lo que entiendes y de dónde aún tienes lagunas. Siempre que te quedes atascado, vuelve y estudia. Repite ese proceso hasta que puedas explicarlo.

Paso 3. Finalmente, hazlo de nuevo, pero ahora simplifica tu lenguaje o usa una analogía para aclarar el punto. Si tu explicación es verbosa o confusa, es una indicación de que no comprende s la idea lo suficientemente bien. Si eso sucede, regresa hasta que la hayas dominado.

Es el proceso de pensar en una idea mientras se la enseña lo que hace que el método sea tan eficaz. Una vez que puedas explicar una idea con un lenguaje simple y crear analogías gráficas, la habrás entendido profundamente y la recordarás durante mucho tiempo.

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was an American physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics (he proposed the parton model).

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world.
He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb and was a member of the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing, and introducing the concept of nanotechnology (creation of devices at the molecular scale). He held the Richard Chace Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, notably a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"" and ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books (""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" and ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"") and books written about him, such as ""Tuva or Bust!""
He was regarded as an eccentric and free spirit. He was a prankster, juggler, safecracker, proud amateur painter, and bongo player. He liked to pursue a variety of seemingly unrelated interests, such as art, percussion, Maya hieroglyphs, and lock picking.

Feynman also had a deep interest in biology, and was a friend of the geneticist and microbiologist Esther Lederberg, who developed replica plating and discovered bacteriophage lambda. They had several mutual physicist friends who, after beginning their careers in nuclear research, moved for moral reasons into genetics, among them Leó Szilárd, Guido Pontecorvo, and Aaron Novick.

119,Richard Feynman: The Beauty of the Flower,173615,2544,0,114,2007-05-03T17:53:54Z,104.0,,"http://www.FreeScienceLectures.com

This video is from 1981. The interview is also the subject of Feynman's book The Pleasure of Finding Things Out.

I have a friend who's an artist and he's some times taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say, ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree, I think. And he says, ""you see, I as an artist can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist, oh, take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing."" And I think he's kind of nutty.

First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me, too, I believe, although I might not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is. But I can appreciate the beauty of a flower.

At the same time, I see much more about the flower that he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside which also have a beauty. I mean, it's not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter: there is also beauty at a smaller dimension, the inner structure... also the processes.

The fact that the colors in the flower are evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting - it means that insects can see the color.

It adds a question - does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms that are... why is it aesthetic, all kinds of interesting questions which a science knowledge only adds to the excitement and mystery and the awe of a flower.

It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.

And this date gave us a very important and interesting Physicist.In this video, we have try to discussed a short and brief biography of Sir Richard Feynman.

About Richard Feynamn :

Richard  P. Feynman was born in New York City on the 11th May 1918. He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he obtained his B.Sc. in 1939 and at Princeton University where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1942. He was Research Assistant at Princeton (1940-1941), Professor of Theoretical Physics at Cornell University (1945-1950), Visiting Professor and thereafter appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology (1950-1959). At present he is Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Professor Feynman is a member of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science; the National Academy of Science; in 1965 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society, London (Great Britain).

He holds the following awards: Albert Einstein Award (1954, Princeton); Einstein Award (Albert Einstein Award College of Medicine); Lawrence Award (1962).

130,The Common Character Trait of Geniuses | James Gleick | Big Think,3330239,45392,0,5424,2014-01-10T17:28:01Z,156.0,en,"What are the common character traits of geniuses?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
OVERVIEW:

James Gleick, who wrote a biography of Isaac Newton, describes the reclusive scientist as ""antisocial, unpleasant and bitter."" Newton fought with his friends ""as much as with his enemies,"" Gleick says. In contrast, Richard Feynman, the subject of another Gleick biography, was ""gregarious, funny, a great dancer."" The superficial differences between the men go on and on. ""Isaac Newton, I believe, never had sex,"" Gleick says. ""Richard Feynman, I believe, had plenty.""

So what could these two men possibly have in common? According to Gleick, when it came to making the great discoveries of science, both men were alone in their heads. This also applies to great geniuses like Charles Babbage, Alan Turing and Ada Byron.  ""They all had the ability to concentrate with a sort of intensity that is hard for mortals like me to grasp,"" Gleick says, ""a kind of passion for abstraction that doesn't lend itself to easy communication.""
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JAMES GLEICK:

James Gleick was born in New York City in 1954. He graduated from Harvard College in 1976 and helped found Metropolis, an alternative weekly newspaper in Minneapolis. Then he worked for ten years as an editor and reporter for The New York Times.

His first book, Chaos, was a National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize finalist and a national bestseller. He collaborated with the photographer Eliot Porter on Nature's Chaos and with developers at Autodesk on Chaos: The Software. His next books include the best-selling biographies, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman and Isaac Newton, both shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize, as well as Faster and What Just Happened. They have been translated into twenty-five languages.

In 1989-90 he was the McGraw Distinguished Lecturer at Princeton University. For some years he wrote the Fast Forward column in the New York Times Magazine.

With Uday Ivatury, he founded The Pipeline, a pioneering New York City-based Internet service in 1993, and was its chairman and chief executive officer until 1995. He was the first editor of the Best American Science Writing series. He is active on the boards of the Authors Guild and the Key West Literary Seminar.

In Chinese, it's a Chung Wong Tah."" Etcetera.

If you don’t really have a head for math and science, physics may be the most intimidating subject of them all. It’s space and time, the make-up of the entire universe - incredibly abstract and mind-bending stuff, and enough to make a lot of students throw in the towel. And that’s where Professor Richard Feynman really made his mark - of course he did all kinds of groundbreaking work, like his theory of quantum electrodynamics…. he proposed the parton model in the field of particle physics… was even part of the atomic bomb project.

But he was also an amazing teacher, this dynamic and charismatic lecturer who made physics fun. He was one of those rare people who not only naturally understood math and science - he was actually able to make other people understand it too. And like it.

Starting in 1966, science historian Charles Weiner interviewed Richard Feynman as part of a big oral history project at the American Institute of Physics. Recording hours of conversation, Weiner captured the details of Feynman’s entire career, his whole life. In those hours, Feynman talked about his earliest memories - what and who shaped the world-famous physicist - and teacher he’d later become. And most influential of all…. a man who was neither a scientist nor a mathematician - a man who didn’t even have any formal education - his dad.

As part of our special series, The Experimenters -- uncovering interviews with the icons of science, technology, and innovation -- we found this interview with Feynman in the archives of the American Institute of Physics.

162,Richard Feynman on confusion and feeling stupid,2916,86,0,5,2021-03-24T14:55:03Z,57.0,,"When you’re thinking about something that you don’t understand, you have a terrible, uncomfortable feeling called confusion. It’s a very difficult and unhappy business. And so, most of the time, you’re rather unhappy, actually, with this confusion. You can’t penetrate this thing.


The confusion is because we are some kind of apes that are kind of stupid, trying to put two sticks together to reach the banana, and we can’t quite make it. And I got this feeling all the time, that I’m an ape trying to put two sticks together. So I always feel stupid. Once in a while though, the sticks go together on me and I reach the banana.

169,Richard Feynman - The Great Explainer,3481,379,0,3,2023-02-28T05:00:33Z,59.0,en-US,"Richard Feynman was an American Nobel Laureate who made groundbreaking contributions to the field of quantum mechanics and particle physics and pioneered the concept of nanotechnology. His invention of the Feynman Diagram helped bring much-needed visual clarification to the behavior of subatomic particles. In the early 1960s, at Caltech he produced a series of lectures that later became The Feynman Lectures on Physics. These lectures were aimed at students who had no previous knowledge of particle physics. Feynman was a master of taking the mystery out of complex scientific principles. He was called the “Great Explainer.” Through his teaching style he showed the world that anyone irrespective of their IQ was capable of learning the most complicated things in a simple, systematic and elegant way.

The Feynman Technique is a four-step process  for deeply learning and internalizing topics.  

Step 1 – Study
The first step is simple and intuitive. All you have to do is choose a topic and start studying - make notes and understand the material. Then break it down into its most basic components and seek to understand it as a whole.

Step 2 – Teach
In the second step - it’s time to teach it to someone else. You will have to simplify your words, perhaps come up with analogies and stories, and be forced with speak plain terms. Ideally, the person you’re teaching will ask questions and probe you, trying to find holes in your knowledge base.  

Step 3 – Fill the Gaps
If you got Phubbed or you failed to teach the concept to the child you will uncover some gaps in your knowledge. You will now have to go back to studying, but this time your reading is  focused on filling these knowledge gaps. The aim here  is to turn your knowledge gaps into areas of your strength. 

If you are struggling to identify your knowledge gaps just ask yourself these 2 questions: Which parts did I struggle to explain? 
Which details did I miss? 

Finally Step 4 – Simplify, Organize & Tell a story
Simplify the content. This step builds a cohesive understanding of the topic. To be able to cut away the fluff and explain something so clearly that even young children with limited vocabulary can easily understand and get excited about. It’s hard to do unless we have deep mastery of the topic and fully understand how all of the different things interact with each other.  

Teaching in this way improves our Communication Skills which is a very different skill set. The most knowledgeable people quite commonly are not good teachers because of their inability to simplify concepts and lack the ability to get down to meet their learners at their level. The Feynman technique promotes Critical Thinking and encourages us to find simple innovative explanations for tricky ideas. When you master this technique it translates beautifully into a critical life skill we all need.

Really good ideas and strokes of genius are often manifest in the right questions being asked: How small can information be encoded? How can information be written? How can information it be read? All of these important ""Hows"" were asked by Feynman in a time when computers had to be put in large rooms and when the impending space race was forcing engineers to do some serious strategic thinking in making technology small enough to be lifted by rockets into space to function as serious tools in scientific exploration and defence.

Feynman himself may not have invented the technology we see in the development and continuity of the computer age, but the fact that even in the early 1960's nanotechnology was being considered as a serious field of study was definitely a factor contributing to the boom in computer technology seen in the late 20th century and continues to reach more spectacular levels of sophistication in the 21st century.

Jump 25 years forward into the year 1984, when Feynman tries to retell his 1959 lecture from a more modern perspective in that many aspects of his vision have been fulfilled, particularly with the invention of the electron microscope, the atomic force microscope and experimental manipulation of the atomic scale of matter. Also discussed is the current practical field of photolithography for the manufacture of bipolar transistors and junctions used in computer chips done on an industrial scale and how this process continues with ever decreasing wavelength capabilities of lasers from UV to X-rays. Feynman also discusses the boundaries of miniaturization and how the scale differences affect the function of certain aspects of technology as well as in nature. 

In the true spirit of Feynman, the discussion goes into the colorful details and gives diagrammatic examples of how this field had progressed from 1959 to 1984. We can only imagine how Feynman would have felt about the modern developments in nanotechnology in the 21st century where entirely exotic principles of physics may begin to become technologically significant, including vacuum fluctuations and quantum entanglements. Without a doubt he would have found our developments exciting but always within the realms of understanding by studying the most fundamental language of nature, quantum mechanics, to bring our macroscopic brains into visualizing, however abstractly, the tiny machinery of nature.","['Richard Feynman', 'Nanotechnology', 'Physics', 'Lecture', 'Material', 'Science', 'Electronics', 'Tiny', 'Robots', 'Machines', 'Computer', 'Technology', 'Feynman', ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"", 'Semiconductor']",Muon Ray

#QuantumMechanics#RichardFeynman#Motivation#MotivationalSpeaker#BillGates#richardfeynmanquotes#quotes#studyhard#exams#feyman#motivation#inspirational

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was an American physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics (he proposed the parton model).

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world.
He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb and was a member of the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing, and introducing the concept of nanotechnology (creation of devices at the molecular scale). He held the Richard Chace Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, notably a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called ""There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"" and ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books (""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" and ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"") and books written about him, such as ""Tuva or Bust!""
He was regarded as an eccentric and free spirit. He was a prankster, juggler, safecracker, proud amateur painter, and bongo player. He liked to pursue a variety of seemingly unrelated interests, such as art, percussion, Maya hieroglyphs, and lock picking.

Feynman also had a deep interest in biology, and was a friend of the geneticist and microbiologist Esther Lederberg, who developed replica plating and discovered bacteriophage lambda. They had several mutual physicist friends who, after beginning their careers in nuclear research, moved for moral reasons into genetics, among them Leó Szilárd, Guido Pontecorvo, and Aaron Novick.

But it is true that if we look in glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe    There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth's rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe's age, and the evolution of the stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it!

If in our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts - physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on - remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let us give one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!

Catering to all, these shorts will be informative and educative. Explore science, explore Nanotechnology through our latest series called Nano Shorts.

Nanotechnology is the buzz of the world today. Here are some lesser known facts about this emerging technology: 

""Nanotechnology was first introduced in 1959 by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman.
 
He proposed using normal-sized robots to construct smaller replicas of themselves and then using the new set to manufacture an even smaller set, and so on, until the molecular scale is reached. 

Materials scientists, mechanical and electronic engineers and medical researchers are teaming up with biologists, physicists and chemists. Research at the nanoscale is unified by the need to pool knowledge on tools and techniques and to share expertise. 

Nanotechnology is already having an impact on novel foods, medical devices, chemical coatings, personal health testing kits, sensors for security systems, water purification units for manned space craft, displays for hand-held computer games, and high-resolution cinema screens.

Nanotechnology will change our lives in many ways. It is important that it is developed responsibly and that it also addresses the concerns of citizens. 

The challenge of nanotechnology is to produce useful new materials with customized properties. 

Nanotechnology is multidisciplinary. To turn nanoscience into successful technologies will require integration of the sciences and a new type of researcher with a broad interdisciplinary view.""

It was given by the American Physicist, Richard Feynman, who won the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in quantum electrodynamics. The crux of the Feynman technique is, ""if you want to understand something better, try to explain it simply."" 

The Feynman technique has 4 steps:

1. Write the name of the topic on a piece of paper
2. Explain it in the simplest way possible. Don't just write the concept. Use examples and illustrations too.
3. After writing, explain the concept as if you are teaching a class. Don't use complicated language. Explain it in the simplest way possible.
4. Go back to the wear areas. The places where you struggled in step 3 are your weak links. You haven't understood them. Work on them.

To improve step 3, instead of explaining to a class or anyone, explain it to a kid. That is because a kid will ask why at many places. The more number of whys you answer, the better you understand.

In Richard Feynman's language, ""If you want to master something, teach it.""","['Feynman Technique', 'Richard Feynman', 'Learning', 'Education', 'Science']",The Secrets of the Universe

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was an American theoretical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and particle physics. Feynman developed a new way of understanding quantum mechanics called the ""Feynman diagram,"" which has become a standard tool for theoretical physicists. In addition to his scientific work, Feynman was an engaging and popular teacher, and wrote several books for a general audience, including ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" and ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics."" He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics.

Richard Feynman was one of the greatest problem solvers of the 20th century and loved being puzzled and solving puzzles, a quality that made him a legendary physicist. To be good at science is to be good at being puzzled and seeing puzzles in everyday phenomena that are taken for granted, allowing you to see what is right in front of you in a new and exciting point of view. This allows for huge developments and innovations that are completely different from anything before.

One of the 3 winners of the 1965 Nobel prize in Physics for his work, Feynman is was an expert on quantum mechanics and developed the Path Integral formulation of Relativistic Quantum mechanics, used in Quantum Field Theory, interpreted the Born series of scattering amplitudes as vertices and Green's function propagators in his famous diagrams, the Feynman Diagrams, and also worked on the fundamental excitations in Liquid Helium leading to a correct model describing superfluidity using phonons, maxons and rotons to describe the various excitation curves. 

During the Manhatten Project, Richard Feynman performed theoretical calculations on the first nuclear weapons developed during the Manhatten project with his supervisor Hans Bethe. They extended Serber's original formula for the yield of a nuclear weapon and developed the Bethe-Feynman formula, which is still classified by the US government even today.

Other fields of work include the Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory for Electromagnetic Radiation, developed with his colleague John A. Wheeler, which was the first attempt to create a theory of electromagnetism that obeys time-reversal theory. 

He also developed the Feynman-Hellmann Theorem, which can be formulated from his own Path Intregral interpretation and relate the derivative of the total energy of any system to the expectation value of the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to a single parameter, e.g volume.

This theory makes possible the calculation of the intramolecular forces of individual molecule in terms of the electronic density (ρ(r)) and the atomic coordinates and nuclear charges of the individual atoms. This, simulated on computers, allows dynamical molecular and quantum systems to be simulated on powerful computers. Such technology is only beginning to have applications in the fields of simulating how proteins fold, how to design drugs that act specifically on biochemical processes and how to simulate quantum logic and computation, something Feynman had predicted long before before the first atomic traps were invented.

Feynman was also a huge visionary in the fields of nanotechnology and small scale manufacturing, something which has led to the modern age and continues to accelerate to new developments in human civilization today.","['Richard Feynman', 'Physics', 'Problem', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Nobel Prize', 'Mathematics']",Muon Ray

234,What Makes Everything Work | Richard Feynman | Curiosity,4652,197,0,7,2019-02-18T01:16:18Z,119.0,en-US,"It had to do with curiosity.

It has to do with people wondering what makes something do something, and then to discover that if you try to get answers that they're related to each other.

That the things that make the wind make the waves, and the motion of water is like the motion of air and it's like the motion of sand.

The fact that things have common features turns out more and more universal.

What we're looking for is how everything works and what makes everything work.

And what happens first in the history is we discover the things that are on the face that are obvious.

And then gradually we ask more questions and then we dig in a little deeper to things that...

We need to do a little more complicated experiment to find out about it.

But it's curiosity as to where we are? What we are?

It's very much more exciting to discover we're on a ball, half of us sticking upside down.

It's spinning around in space, there's a mysterious force which holds us on, it's going around a great big glob of gas that's burning fueled by a fire that's completely different than any fire we can make,

well, now we can make that fire, nuclear fire,

but that's much more exciting story to many people then the tales which other people used to make up, who worried about the universe, that we were living on the back of a turtle or something like that.

They were wonderful stories but the truth is so much more remarkable.

And so what's the pleasure in physics, to me, is that as it's revealed, the truth is so remarkable, so amazing.

And I have this disease, and many other people who have studied far enough to begin to understand a little of how things work are fascinated by it, and this fascination drives them on to such an extent, that they've been able to convince governments, and so on, to keep supporting them in this investigation that the race is making into its own environment","['Richard Feynman', 'curiosity', 'questions']",VidaAxis

245,Richard Feynman - Fixing Radios,27184,392,0,23,2013-06-27T19:00:53Z,782.0,,"Richard Feynman speaks about how, as 12 year old boy, he was asked by repairmen in a hotel to fix radios; prompting him to make a small business out of it.

Using the same lab he had made as a 10 year old, he also was employing his sister Joan as an assistant at a salary of four cents a week. By 15, he'd taught himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, analytic geometry and calculus, and in his last year of high school won the New York University Math Championship, shocking the judges not only by his score, but by how much higher it was than those of his competitors.

As with any person, childhood events and experience help shape people as they grow up and influences lifestyle choices. It is important to note that Richard Feynman was not given these opportunities to experiment, explore and grow by pure chance.
In this case his aunt, who owned the hotel, had told people about her nephew's abilities and helped nurture them. Similarly his father and mother fueled his curiosity and helped him grow mentally. Richard's sister Joan also helped him develop, as she was equally curious herself thanks to an upbringing equally nurturing to her mind Richard's and allowed her to become an astrophysicist. Richard's first wife, second wife and children also had an impact on his unique outlook on the world and also helped him communicate his ideas, making him the legendary teacher and lecturer that millions of people, both scientists and laymen, appreciate today. 

The story of Richard Feynman is something we can all learn from, parents in particular, in that we should always nurture the positive aspects in our children, siblings, friends and life partners to help them grow.","['Richard Feynman', 'Radios', 'Physics', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Quantum Theory', 'Quantum Field Theory', 'Quantum Electrodynamics', 'Ralph Leighton', 'Feynman Lectures', 'Feynman Tapes', 'Feynman Talks']",Muon Ray

Mit der Feynman Methode kannst du in kürzester Zeit ein tiefes Verständnis über so ziemlich jedes Thema entwicklen. Die perfekte Basis um nur noch 1er zu schreiben 🙂

Die Feynman-Methode besteht aus 4 Schritten:

Schritt 1: Erkläre das Thema, das du gerade lernen willst, einer anderen Person in möglichst einfachen Worten. Einmal komplett von vorne bis hinten. 
Die Person muss dabei nicht real existieren. Hauptsache du erklärst es schriftlich, oder laut mündlich. Was dir eben besser gefällt. 

Schritt 2: Identifiziere Wissenslücken. Jedes mal wenn du in Erklärungsnot gerätst, oder wenn du komplizierte Begriffe und Fachwörter verwendest, mache dir dazu eine kleine Notiz. 

Schritt 3: Fülle Wissenslücken auf. Schlage dafür einfach alles, was du dir in Schritt 2 notiert hast, in deinen Büchern oder in anderen Quellen nach. Versuche für Fachbegriffe und komplizierte Wörter, entweder einfachere Wörter oder treffende Bilder und Alltagsbeispiele zu finden.

Schritt 4: Wiederhole den Prozess und vereinfache so lange, bis du das gesamte Thema von vorne bis hinten ohne Probleme und ohne Fachbegriffe erklären kannst. 

Das zentrale Element der Feynman-Methode ist das Vereinfachen, denn hier passiert die Magie. Um jemandem etwas anschaulich erklären zu können, der nicht den selben Wissenshintergrund hat wie du, musst du alles auf Grundlage der Dinge erklären, die der Andere bereits kennt.

Richard Feynman gives us a lecture on Quantum electrodynamcis, the theory of photons and electron interactions which incorporates his unique view of the fundamental processes that create it. one of the 3 winners of the 1965 Nobel prize in Physics for his work, Feynman is was an expert on quantum mechanics and developed the Path Integral formulation of Relativistic Quantum mechanics, used in Quantum Field Theory, interpreted the Born series of scattering amplitudes as vertices and Green's function propagators in his famous diagrams, the Feynman Diagrams, and also worked on the fundamental excitations in Liquid Helium leading to a correct model describing superfluidity using phonons, maxons and rotons to describe the various excitation curves.

he also worked on the Rogers Commission report during the investigation of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where Feynman famously demonstrated how the Booster Rocket O-rings, which are elastic sealing joints, became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water- his high intelligence and independant way of looking at the world often made him ""a real pain"" in the eyes of other, less skilled, Commission members. 
Feynman's own investigation reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts, such as safety proceedures. 
Although Feynman got plenty of media coverage due to him being on the Commission, he was often told to stay quiet about NASA's more sinister secrets and tactics in space exploration.","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Quantum', 'electrodynamics', 'Field', 'Theory', 'Mechanics', 'photons', 'electrons', 'electromagnetism', 'nuclear', 'forces', 'fundamental', 'physics', 'lectures', 'QED', 'elementary', 'particles', 'chemistry', 'Richard Feynman Lecture', 'Quantum Electrodynamics', 'Quantum Mechanics', ""Maxwell's Equations"", 'Gravity', 'Newton', 'Richard Feynman QED']",Muon Ray
249,Richard Feynman on the Role of Interpretation in Physics,1576,58,0,2,2022-11-16T21:54:11Z,51.0,en,"In 1963 Richard Feynman was invited to give the 1964 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University, an annual tradition since 1924, when Hiram Messenger gifted Cornell with ""a fund to provide a course of lectures on the Evolution of Civilization for the special purpose of raising the moral standard of our political, business, and social life"", to be ""delivered by the ablest non-resident lecturer or lecturers obtainable"".

Feynman had been a physics professor at Cornell from 1945 to 1950, during which time he did the work for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1965. While at Cornell Feynman became well-known in the physics community for his innovations in quantum electrodynamics and idosyncratic style. He was at Caltech in 1963, when he was invited to become the 41st Messenger Lecturer1, by which time he had become known to a much wider audience through his recently published book, Volume I of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.2

According to the Cornell Faculty Website, ""A Messenger Lecturer typically gives three lectures/presentations over the course of a one-week visit. At least one of these must be a lecture that is suitable for a general audience.""3 Feynman, however, chose to give a series of six lectures, all for a general audience, which he titled The Character of Physical Law.4 He had plenty of material to draw from his recently completed introductory physics course, the basis of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. For this reason one finds many similarities, parallels, and even identical parts in the lectures of The Character of Physical Law and several of the lectures in The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

Feynman's Messenger Lectures were videotaped by the BBC, who in 1965 published a hardbound book of edited lecture transcripts under the title, The Character of Physical Law. In 1967 the paperback rights were licensed to MIT Press who continues to print the book today.5 The videotapes were transferred to film, and in the late 1960s through the '70s copies of the films were in wide distribution at colleges and universities.6 Sadly, however, these wonderful films of Feynman lecturing at the peak of his prowess went out of distribution and became generally unavailable in the 1980s.

In 2009, when Microsoft Research introduced their Silverlight framework for media-rich web applications, Bill Gates licensed rights to stream the BBC's films of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures online. Hoping to encourage others to make educational content available for free, he used them in the first Silverlight demo, “Project Tuva.”7 The publication of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures for free online viewing, with special features such as searchable synchronized scrolling transcripts, links to related online material, and commentary, was an instant hit with Feynman fans, students and physicists. The Silverlight framework, however, was not widely adopted, and in 2016 Project Tuva was retired. The videos were still available for viewing on the Microsoft Research Website (though without the special features) until 2021, when their BBC license expired. The license has since been generously renewed by Bill Gates so that the videos can continue to be shown online to users of The Feynman Lectures Website.

251,Nanotechnology - THE ORIGIN & CHALLENGE by Richard Feynman | Nano Tv,2523,41,0,1,2022-04-02T08:37:12Z,127.0,en,"This new feature in Nano TV will present the best of science and technology in short format, which is easy to understand and also appreciate the beauty of scientific knowledge. Catering to all, these shorts will be informative and educative. Explore science, explore Nanotechnology through our latest series called Nano Shorts.

Nanotechnology is the buzz of the world today. Here are some lesser known facts about this emerging technology: 

""Nanotechnology was first introduced in 1959 by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman.
 
He proposed using normal-sized robots to construct smaller replicas of themselves and then using the new set to manufacture an even smaller set, and so on, until the molecular scale is reached. 

Materials scientists, mechanical and electronic engineers and medical researchers are teaming up with biologists, physicists and chemists. Research at the nanoscale is unified by the need to pool knowledge on tools and techniques and to share expertise. 

Nanotechnology is already having an impact on novel foods, medical devices, chemical coatings, personal health testing kits, sensors for security systems, water purification units for manned space craft, displays for hand-held computer games, and high-resolution cinema screens.

Nanotechnology will change our lives in many ways. It is important that it is developed responsibly and that it also addresses the concerns of citizens. 

The challenge of nanotechnology is to produce useful new materials with customized properties. 

Nanotechnology is multidisciplinary. To turn nanoscience into successful technologies will require integration of the sciences and a new type of researcher with a broad interdisciplinary view.""

252,The Feynman Technique of Learning Better | Richard Feynman | The Secrets of the Universe,32778,1375,0,22,2020-01-17T04:30:13Z,198.0,,"The Feynman technique of learning is one of the best learning techniques. It was given by the American Physicist, Richard Feynman, who won the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in quantum electrodynamics. The crux of the Feynman technique is, ""if you want to understand something better, try to explain it simply."" 

The Feynman technique has 4 steps:

1. Write the name of the topic on a piece of paper
2. Explain it in the simplest way possible. Don't just write the concept. Use examples and illustrations too.
3. After writing, explain the concept as if you are teaching a class. Don't use complicated language. Explain it in the simplest way possible.
4. Go back to the wear areas. The places where you struggled in step 3 are your weak links. You haven't understood them. Work on them.

To improve step 3, instead of explaining to a class or anyone, explain it to a kid. That is because a kid will ask why at many places. The more number of whys you answer, the better you understand.

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was an American theoretical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and particle physics. Feynman developed a new way of understanding quantum mechanics called the ""Feynman diagram,"" which has become a standard tool for theoretical physicists. In addition to his scientific work, Feynman was an engaging and popular teacher, and wrote several books for a general audience, including ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" and ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics."" He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics.

It has to do with people wondering what makes something do something, and then to discover that if you try to get answers that they're related to each other.

That the things that make the wind make the waves, and the motion of water is like the motion of air and it's like the motion of sand.

The fact that things have common features turns out more and more universal.

What we're looking for is how everything works and what makes everything work.

And what happens first in the history is we discover the things that are on the face that are obvious.

And then gradually we ask more questions and then we dig in a little deeper to things that...

We need to do a little more complicated experiment to find out about it.

But it's curiosity as to where we are? What we are?

It's very much more exciting to discover we're on a ball, half of us sticking upside down.

It's spinning around in space, there's a mysterious force which holds us on, it's going around a great big glob of gas that's burning fueled by a fire that's completely different than any fire we can make,

well, now we can make that fire, nuclear fire,

but that's much more exciting story to many people then the tales which other people used to make up, who worried about the universe, that we were living on the back of a turtle or something like that.

They were wonderful stories but the truth is so much more remarkable.

And so what's the pleasure in physics, to me, is that as it's revealed, the truth is so remarkable, so amazing.

And I have this disease, and many other people who have studied far enough to begin to understand a little of how things work are fascinated by it, and this fascination drives them on to such an extent, that they've been able to convince governments, and so on, to keep supporting them in this investigation that the race is making into its own environment","['Richard Feynman', 'curiosity', 'questions']",VidaAxis

Richard Feynman was one of the greatest problem solvers of the 20th century and loved being puzzled and solving puzzles, a quality that made him a legendary physicist. To be good at science is to be good at being puzzled and seeing puzzles in everyday phenomena that are taken for granted, allowing you to see what is right in front of you in a new and exciting point of view. This allows for huge developments and innovations that are completely different from anything before.

One of the 3 winners of the 1965 Nobel prize in Physics for his work, Feynman is was an expert on quantum mechanics and developed the Path Integral formulation of Relativistic Quantum mechanics, used in Quantum Field Theory, interpreted the Born series of scattering amplitudes as vertices and Green's function propagators in his famous diagrams, the Feynman Diagrams, and also worked on the fundamental excitations in Liquid Helium leading to a correct model describing superfluidity using phonons, maxons and rotons to describe the various excitation curves. 

During the Manhatten Project, Richard Feynman performed theoretical calculations on the first nuclear weapons developed during the Manhatten project with his supervisor Hans Bethe. They extended Serber's original formula for the yield of a nuclear weapon and developed the Bethe-Feynman formula, which is still classified by the US government even today.

Other fields of work include the Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory for Electromagnetic Radiation, developed with his colleague John A. Wheeler, which was the first attempt to create a theory of electromagnetism that obeys time-reversal theory. 

He also developed the Feynman-Hellmann Theorem, which can be formulated from his own Path Intregral interpretation and relate the derivative of the total energy of any system to the expectation value of the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to a single parameter, e.g volume.

This theory makes possible the calculation of the intramolecular forces of individual molecule in terms of the electronic density (ρ(r)) and the atomic coordinates and nuclear charges of the individual atoms. This, simulated on computers, allows dynamical molecular and quantum systems to be simulated on powerful computers. Such technology is only beginning to have applications in the fields of simulating how proteins fold, how to design drugs that act specifically on biochemical processes and how to simulate quantum logic and computation, something Feynman had predicted long before before the first atomic traps were invented.

Feynman was also a huge visionary in the fields of nanotechnology and small scale manufacturing, something which has led to the modern age and continues to accelerate to new developments in human civilization today.","['Richard Feynman', 'Physics', 'Problem', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Nobel Prize', 'Mathematics']",Muon Ray

Using the same lab he had made as a 10 year old, he also was employing his sister Joan as an assistant at a salary of four cents a week. By 15, he'd taught himself trigonometry, advanced algebra, analytic geometry and calculus, and in his last year of high school won the New York University Math Championship, shocking the judges not only by his score, but by how much higher it was than those of his competitors.

As with any person, childhood events and experience help shape people as they grow up and influences lifestyle choices. It is important to note that Richard Feynman was not given these opportunities to experiment, explore and grow by pure chance.
In this case his aunt, who owned the hotel, had told people about her nephew's abilities and helped nurture them. Similarly his father and mother fueled his curiosity and helped him grow mentally. Richard's sister Joan also helped him develop, as she was equally curious herself thanks to an upbringing equally nurturing to her mind Richard's and allowed her to become an astrophysicist. Richard's first wife, second wife and children also had an impact on his unique outlook on the world and also helped him communicate his ideas, making him the legendary teacher and lecturer that millions of people, both scientists and laymen, appreciate today. 

The story of Richard Feynman is something we can all learn from, parents in particular, in that we should always nurture the positive aspects in our children, siblings, friends and life partners to help them grow.","['Richard Feynman', 'Radios', 'Physics', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Quantum Theory', 'Quantum Field Theory', 'Quantum Electrodynamics', 'Ralph Leighton', 'Feynman Lectures', 'Feynman Tapes', 'Feynman Talks']",Muon Ray

Richard Feynman gives us a lecture on Quantum electrodynamcis, the theory of photons and electron interactions which incorporates his unique view of the fundamental processes that create it. one of the 3 winners of the 1965 Nobel prize in Physics for his work, Feynman is was an expert on quantum mechanics and developed the Path Integral formulation of Relativistic Quantum mechanics, used in Quantum Field Theory, interpreted the Born series of scattering amplitudes as vertices and Green's function propagators in his famous diagrams, the Feynman Diagrams, and also worked on the fundamental excitations in Liquid Helium leading to a correct model describing superfluidity using phonons, maxons and rotons to describe the various excitation curves.

he also worked on the Rogers Commission report during the investigation of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where Feynman famously demonstrated how the Booster Rocket O-rings, which are elastic sealing joints, became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water- his high intelligence and independant way of looking at the world often made him ""a real pain"" in the eyes of other, less skilled, Commission members. 
Feynman's own investigation reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts, such as safety proceedures. 
Although Feynman got plenty of media coverage due to him being on the Commission, he was often told to stay quiet about NASA's more sinister secrets and tactics in space exploration.","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Quantum', 'electrodynamics', 'Field', 'Theory', 'Mechanics', 'photons', 'electrons', 'electromagnetism', 'nuclear', 'forces', 'fundamental', 'physics', 'lectures', 'QED', 'elementary', 'particles', 'chemistry', 'Richard Feynman Lecture', 'Quantum Electrodynamics', 'Quantum Mechanics', ""Maxwell's Equations"", 'Gravity', 'Newton', 'Richard Feynman QED']",Muon Ray

272,Richard Feynman on the Role of Interpretation in Physics,1576,58,0,2,2022-11-16T21:54:11Z,51.0,en,"In 1963 Richard Feynman was invited to give the 1964 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University, an annual tradition since 1924, when Hiram Messenger gifted Cornell with ""a fund to provide a course of lectures on the Evolution of Civilization for the special purpose of raising the moral standard of our political, business, and social life"", to be ""delivered by the ablest non-resident lecturer or lecturers obtainable"".

Feynman had been a physics professor at Cornell from 1945 to 1950, during which time he did the work for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1965. While at Cornell Feynman became well-known in the physics community for his innovations in quantum electrodynamics and idosyncratic style. He was at Caltech in 1963, when he was invited to become the 41st Messenger Lecturer1, by which time he had become known to a much wider audience through his recently published book, Volume I of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.2

According to the Cornell Faculty Website, ""A Messenger Lecturer typically gives three lectures/presentations over the course of a one-week visit. At least one of these must be a lecture that is suitable for a general audience.""3 Feynman, however, chose to give a series of six lectures, all for a general audience, which he titled The Character of Physical Law.4 He had plenty of material to draw from his recently completed introductory physics course, the basis of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. For this reason one finds many similarities, parallels, and even identical parts in the lectures of The Character of Physical Law and several of the lectures in The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

Feynman's Messenger Lectures were videotaped by the BBC, who in 1965 published a hardbound book of edited lecture transcripts under the title, The Character of Physical Law. In 1967 the paperback rights were licensed to MIT Press who continues to print the book today.5 The videotapes were transferred to film, and in the late 1960s through the '70s copies of the films were in wide distribution at colleges and universities.6 Sadly, however, these wonderful films of Feynman lecturing at the peak of his prowess went out of distribution and became generally unavailable in the 1980s.

In 2009, when Microsoft Research introduced their Silverlight framework for media-rich web applications, Bill Gates licensed rights to stream the BBC's films of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures online. Hoping to encourage others to make educational content available for free, he used them in the first Silverlight demo, “Project Tuva.”7 The publication of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures for free online viewing, with special features such as searchable synchronized scrolling transcripts, links to related online material, and commentary, was an instant hit with Feynman fans, students and physicists. The Silverlight framework, however, was not widely adopted, and in 2016 Project Tuva was retired. The videos were still available for viewing on the Microsoft Research Website (though without the special features) until 2021, when their BBC license expired. The license has since been generously renewed by Bill Gates so that the videos can continue to be shown online to users of The Feynman Lectures Website.

Richard Feynman. Physicist, Artist and Bongo Drum Player. Here, after a lecture, he plays his signature ""Orange Juice"" theme with his friend and fellow drum player, Ralph Leighton.
Richard Feynman, Along with Julian Schwinger and Shin-Itiro Tomonaga, was the reciever of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on Quantum Electrodynamics for which Feynman took the theories surrounding the logarithms and integrals developed by Schwinger and Feynman himself, with the help of noted physicist Hans Bethe, and developed them into simple path integrals in a formalism that bears his name. Feynman's Path Integral Formalism borrows on the Hamilton's Principle for Least Action and assigns probability amplitudes which are proportional to the exponent of the action S. action being the integral of the Lagrangian. This means that the Dirac Lagrangian, when modified for Gauge Invariance, can give the entire dynamics from the system and, among other things, allows you to construct those famous Feynman Diagrams which looked so good he put them on his van! Feynman's sum over histories is also an interesting side-effect of the Path Integral Formalism as it explains how interference pattens form due to vector potential the electron ""sees"". The use of Feynman's rules was also the foundation for the Renormalisation Group work done by Feynman but also tackled more rigorously by Freeman Dyson and Murray Gell-Mann. Feynman had a huge influence on physics in the latter part of the 20th century and helped popularise his view of the world and encourage us to, as Leonard Susskind aptly put it, ""To take as much baloney out of our sandwiches as possible.""","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Bongo', 'Drum', 'Orange', 'Juice', 'Physicist', 'Quantum', 'Electrodynamics', 'Theory']",Muon Ray

Richard Feynman talks about some of his unusual patents and how they came into being through some of his own ideas for possible.nuclear powered vehicles, which he brainstormed during his time working on the atomic bomb in The Manhattan Project.
Feynman himself had no idea they would patent these ideas and only found out about it when he was offered a job of being the head of a research team to develop a nuclear powered aircraft. Feynman did not accept this job, as he was a theoretical physicist and aircraft engineering was of no interest to him. 

For legal reasons, a dollar was to be exchanged for the patent papers. Since Feynman received no dollar, he went to the patent office to get his dollar and used it to buy sweets as a joke to the bureaucratic and anal nature of patent law and the goons who enforce it.","['Richard Feynman', 'Patents', 'Physics', 'Quantum', 'Nuclear', 'Manhattan Project', 'nuclear powered vehicles', 'nuclear powered aircraft', 'Nuclear Power (Industry)']",Muon Ray

Richard Phillips Feynman (/ˈfaɪnmən/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics (he proposed the parton model). For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.[3]

He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing,[4][5] and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard Chace Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Richard and Arline Greenbaum were soul mates. They were a perfect symbiotic pair, each completing the other. They shared the love we all seek.
Feynman was fond of writing love letters to Arline. Many of them appear in Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track.

None is more beautiful than the one Richard wrote to Arline sixteen months after her death.


October 17, 1946

D’Arline,

I adore you, sweetheart.

I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.

It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.

But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.

I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the “idea-woman” and general instigator of all our wild adventures.

When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.

I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.

My darling wife, I do adore you.

I love my wife. My wife is dead.

Rich.

It is interesting how Feynman spent a lot of his formative years indoors working on experiments and during this time we are living in it seems now more than ever that it is valuable wisdom to live by. Feynman also talks about a funny incident involving a fire starting in his lab which he stopped quickly and which finally forced him outdoors!

But Richard Feynman was so much more than just one of the greatest physicists, the greatest scientists, of the 20th century. He was a beautiful writer, a man of boundless curiosity, a bongo player, a clown. Fellow physicist Freeman Dyson once said that Feynman was ""Half genius, half buffoon"". He would later revise those words, replacing them with ""All genius, all buffoon.""

317,The Role of Interpretation in Physics (Richard Feynman),383,15,0,0,2019-12-26T10:12:34Z,51.0,en,"In 1963 Richard Feynman was invited to give the 1964 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University, an annual tradition since 1924, when Hiram Messenger gifted Cornell with ""a fund to provide a course of lectures on the Evolution of Civilization for the special purpose of raising the moral standard of our political, business, and social life"", to be ""delivered by the ablest non-resident lecturer or lecturers obtainable"".

Feynman had been a physics professor at Cornell from 1945 to 1950, during which time he did the work for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1965. While at Cornell Feynman became well-known in the physics community for his innovations in quantum electrodynamics and idosyncratic style. He was at Caltech in 1963, when he was invited to become the 41st Messenger Lecturer1, by which time he had become known to a much wider audience through his recently published book, Volume I of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.2

According to the Cornell Faculty Website, ""A Messenger Lecturer typically gives three lectures/presentations over the course of a one-week visit. At least one of these must be a lecture that is suitable for a general audience.""3 Feynman, however, chose to give a series of six lectures, all for a general audience, which he titled The Character of Physical Law.4 He had plenty of material to draw from his recently completed introductory physics course, the basis of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. For this reason one finds many similarities, parallels, and even identical parts in the lectures of The Character of Physical Law and several of the lectures in The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

Feynman's Messenger Lectures were videotaped by the BBC, who in 1965 published a hardbound book of edited lecture transcripts under the title, The Character of Physical Law. In 1967 the paperback rights were licensed to MIT Press who continues to print the book today.5 The videotapes were transferred to film, and in the late 1960s through the '70s copies of the films were in wide distribution at colleges and universities.6 Sadly, however, these wonderful films of Feynman lecturing at the peak of his prowess went out of distribution and became generally unavailable in the 1980s.

In 2009, when Microsoft Research introduced their Silverlight framework for media-rich web applications, Bill Gates licensed rights to stream the BBC's films of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures online. Hoping to encourage others to make educational content available for free, he used them in the first Silverlight demo, “Project Tuva.”7 The publication of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures for free online viewing, with special features such as searchable synchronized scrolling transcripts, links to related online material, and commentary, was an instant hit with Feynman fans, students and physicists. The Silverlight framework, however, was not widely adopted, and in 2016 Project Tuva was retired. The videos were still available for viewing on the Microsoft Research Website (though without the special features) until 2021, when their BBC license expired. The license has since been generously renewed by Bill Gates so that the videos can continue to be shown online to users of The Feynman Lectures Website.","['Richard Feynman', 'Interpretation', 'quantum mechanics']",EISM

Richard Feynman gives us a lecture on Quantum electrodynamcis, the theory of photons and electron interactions which incorporates his unique view of the fundamental processes that create it. one of the 3 winners of the 1965 Nobel prize in Physics for his work, Feynman is was an expert on quantum mechanics and developed the Path Integral formulation of Relativistic Quantum mechanics, used in Quantum Field Theory, interpreted the Born series of scattering amplitudes as vertices and Green's function propagators in his famous diagrams, the Feynman Diagrams, and also worked on the fundamental excitations in Liquid Helium leading to a correct model describing superfluidity using phonons, maxons and rotons to describe the various excitation curves. 
other fields of work include the Feynman-Hellmann Theorem, which can relate the derivative of the total energy of any system to the expectation value of the derivative of the Hamiltonian under a single parameter, e.g volume. 
he also worked on the Rogers Commission report during the investigation of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where Feynman famously demonstrated how the Booster Rocket O-rings, which are elastic sealing joints, became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water- his high intelligence and independant way of looking at the world often made him ""a real pain"" in the eyes of other, less skilled, Commission members. 
Feynman's own investigation reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts, such as safety proceedures. 
Although Feynman got plenty of media coverage due to him being on the Commission, he was often told to stay quiet about NASA's more sinister secrets and tactics in space exploration.","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Quantum', 'electrodynamics', 'Field', 'Theory', 'Mechanics', 'photons', 'electrons', 'electromagnetism', 'nuclear', 'forces', 'fundamental', 'physics', 'lectures', 'QED', 'elementary', 'particles', 'chemistry', 'math', 'technology', 'space', 'experiment', 'electronics']",Muon Ray

328,Richard Feynman - Can Machines Think?,359,5,0,2,2021-02-20T11:30:18Z,536.0,en,"Ave, Coders!
 
There are questions that we as Humanity still cannot find definite answers to, questions that were challenging many generations of writers, scientists, philosophers, and when we think we’ve found a reasonable answer, very soon we begin to doubt it. 
 
But I wonder, what if we could ask those bright minds about their thoughts on resolving those questions and how did they get to their answers? Unfortunately, we still don't have a time machine to ask them these questions personally but we have other artifacts such as books, films and, more recently, the Internet. 
 
Thanks to the latter, we have a chance to pretend to travel back in time and challenge the great minds of their time with these questions.
Specifically, we can travel to the  26th of September of 1985 and ask a famous scientist Richard Feynman: “Do you think there will ever be a machine that will think like human beings and be more intelligent than human beings?”

GENIUS RICHARD FEYNMAN: LA VIDA, EL UNIVERSO Y TODO
Un genio excéntrico, entre las flores, música, maestro carismático, divertido , irreverente, el genio que resolvía ecuaciones complejas de la física en bares de striptease. La curiosidad científica de Richard Feynman no conocía límites.🌏

En pocas palabras, uno de los científicos más extraordinarios del siglo XX. Fue uno de los grandes científicos y físicos de nuestro tiempo, verdaderamente una de las grandes mentes de la humanidad. A continuación, recogemos gran parte de su sabiduría en un solo lugar

""El primer principio es que no debes engañarte a ti mismo, y eres la persona más fácil de engañar"" 🌏🌕

El método de pensamiento Feynmann fue desarrollado por un hombre que rechazó la sabiduría convencional a cualquier paso y que buscó construir su computadora mental desde cero.
Así fue como Feynman abordó todo el conocimiento: ¿Qué puedo saber con certeza y cómo puedo llegar a conocerlo?
Cuando Feynman se enfrenta a un problema, es inusualmente bueno para volver a ser como un niño, ignorando lo que todos los demás piensan . Estaba tan desatascado: si algo no funcionaba, lo miraba de otra manera

Lo que tomamos de Feynman es una búsqueda absoluta e invariable de la racionalidad y la verdad. Feynman preferiría admitir que no sabía algo que creer en el conocimiento falso

Feynman nunca se conformó con conocer la descripción de las cosas o las verdades aceptadas de las cosas. En cambio, realmente quería saber, y fue esa curiosidad ardiente la que lo llevó a su mayor trabajo. Feynman era humano, a veces demasiado humano, pero su mente estaba dedicada a descubrir la realidad de la manera en que era.

Piuttosto descrive molto bene un aspetto importante di quello strumento di indagine della realtà che chiamiamo metodo scientifico. In assenza di dati certi bisogna applicare il rasoio di occam e considerare le ipotesi più semplici come quelle che hanno maggiori probabilità di spiegare il fenomeno in questione. 

Detto questo ritengo personalmente affascinante l'ipotesi extra-terrestre come ipotetica spiegazione del paradosso di Fermi.

Trovo particolarmente interessanti i casi degli avvistamenti multipli avvenuti nei cieli del Belgio negli anni 90, quello del volo cargo della Japan Airlines sopra i cieli dell'Alaska nel 1986 e il tentativo di intercettazione di un caccia iraniano di un oggetto anomalo nello spazio aereo di Tehran nel 1976. 

Sono ben lungi dall'affermare che i casi succitati possano costituire una prova certa a favore dell'ipotesi extra terrestre ma,in considerazione della quantità di dati raccolti, comprese tracce radar e innumerevoli testimonianze oculari, ritengo che questa, per quanto improbabile, non possa assolutamente essere esclusa.","['richard', 'feynman', 'metodo', 'scientifico', 'alieni', 'ufo', 'extra', 'terrestri', 'dischi', 'volanti', 'scienza', 'ragione']",moltimondi

Scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty, but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all arranged as a stage for God to watch man's struggle for good and evil seems inadequate.

Richard Feynman Kimdir
20. yüzyılın en önemli fizikçilerindendir. Kuantum elektrodinamiği üzerindeki çalışmaları nedeniyle 1965'te Julian Schwinger ve Sin-Itiro Tomonaga ile beraber Nobel Fizik Ödülüne layık görülmüştür.1918'de ABD'nin New York eyaletinde Queens'teki Far Rockway adlı küçük bir kasabada dünyaya geldi. Henüz 16 yaşındayken türev ve integral hesabını tüm yönleriyle kavradı. 17 yaşında Rockway'den ayrılıp, lisans derecesini yapacağı MIT 'e girdi. Lisans derecesinden sonra ünlü Princeton Üniversitesi'ne kabul edildi. Doktorasını Princeton'dan aldıktan sonra, dekorsal sanatlar öğretmeni Arline Greenbaum ile ailesinin itirazlarına aldırış etmeyerek evlendi. 1942'de ABD'nin savaşa katılmasıyla birlikte, Manhattan Projesi (atom bombası projesi) için çağrıldı.
Burada Nazilerden kaçıp ABD'ye sığınan, Alman fizikçi Hans Bethe tarafından kuramsal bölümün önderi olarak atandı. Bu görevi aldığında henüz 24 yaşındaydı. Manhattan Projesi'nde Feynman, kritik kütle için gerekli olan uranyum miktarını tespit etmek için çalıştı. Hipotezini denemek için Los Alamos'u havaya uçurmadan birçok deney araçları geliştirdi. Oak Ridge uranyumun parçalanması sırasında güvenlik sorunuyla uğraşırken, Feynman çalışanların ışıma zehirlenmesinden korunması için prosedürler geliştirdi. Savaş sonrası Bethe'yi takip ederek, Cornell Üniversitesi'ne gitti. Feynman burada atomaltı parçacıkların karmaşık yapısı için basit bir gösterim geliştirdi. Onun bu gösterimi Feynman Çizelgeleri olarak bilinir.

Savaş bittikten sonra, 1965'te Kuantum elektrodinamiğine yaptığı katkılardan dolayı Itiro Tomonaga ve Julian Schwinger ile birlikte Nobel Ödülüne layık görüldü. 1986'daki Challenger felaketini araştıran Rogers komisyonunda yer aldı.
1988'de Los Angeles'ta öldü.

Original video:
The Universe in a Glass of Wine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3_n7TDL7lc



Um poeta certa vez disse,
""O universo inteiro está em uma taça de vinho.”
Nós provavelmente nunca saberemos em que sentido ele disse isso,
já que poetas não escrevem para serem entendidos.

Mas a verdade é que, se olharmos uma taça de vinho perto o suficiente,
nós veremos o universo inteiro.

Há as coisas da física: o líquido rodopiante
que evapora dependendo do vento e do clima,
os reflexos no vidro,
e a nossa imaginação acrescenta os átomos.

A taça é uma destilação das rochas da Terra,
e em sua composição nós vemos os segredos da idade do universo,
e da evolução das estrelas.

Que estranho conjunto de substâncias químicas há no vinho?
Como elas vieram a existir?
Há os fermentos, as enzimas, os substratos e os produtos.
Ali no vinho encontra-se a grande generalização:
toda a vida é fermentação.

Ninguém descobre a química do vinho
sem descobrir, como fez Pasteur, a causa de muitas doenças.

Como é vívido o clarete,
impondo sua existência à consciência que o observa!

Se nossas pequenas mentes, por conveniência,
dividem a taça de vinho, este Universo, em partes
— física, biologia, geologia, astronomia, psicologia e tudo o mais —
lembre-se de que a natureza não sabe disso!

Destarte, reunamos tudo de volta,
sem esquecer para que serve, afinal.
Que nos conceda mais um último prazer:
bebê-lo e esquecer tudo isto!



----
A poet once said,
""The whole universe is in a glass of wine.""
We will probably never know in what sense he said that,
for poets do not write to be understood.

But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough
we see the entire universe.

There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid
which evaporates depending on the wind and weather,
the reflections in the glass,
and our imagination adds the atoms.

The glass is a distillation of the Earth's rocks,
and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe's age,
and the evolution of the stars.

What strange array of chemicals are in the wine?
How did they come to be?
There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products.
There in wine is found the great generalization:
all life is fermentation.

Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine
without discovering, as did Pasteur, the cause of much disease.

How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence
into the consciousness that watches it!

If our small minds, for some convenience,
divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts
— physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on —
remember that nature does not know it!

So let us put it all back together,
not forgetting ultimately what it is for.
Let us give one final pleasure more:
drink it up and forget about it all!","['Richard Feynman', 'poema', 'universe in a glass of wine', 'legendado', 'feynman lectures on physics', 'lições de física de feynman']",Poesia of the Universe

Piuttosto descrive molto bene un aspetto importante di quello strumento di indagine della realtà che chiamiamo metodo scientifico. In assenza di dati certi bisogna applicare il rasoio di occam e considerare le ipotesi più semplici come quelle che hanno maggiori probabilità di spiegare il fenomeno in questione. 

Detto questo ritengo personalmente affascinante l'ipotesi extra-terrestre come ipotetica spiegazione del paradosso di Fermi.

Trovo particolarmente interessanti i casi degli avvistamenti multipli avvenuti nei cieli del Belgio negli anni 90, quello del volo cargo della Japan Airlines sopra i cieli dell'Alaska nel 1986 e il tentativo di intercettazione di un caccia iraniano di un oggetto anomalo nello spazio aereo di Tehran nel 1976. 

Sono ben lungi dall'affermare che i casi succitati possano costituire una prova certa a favore dell'ipotesi extra terrestre ma,in considerazione della quantità di dati raccolti, comprese tracce radar e innumerevoli testimonianze oculari, ritengo che questa, per quanto improbabile, non possa assolutamente essere esclusa.","['richard', 'feynman', 'metodo', 'scientifico', 'alieni', 'ufo', 'extra', 'terrestri', 'dischi', 'volanti', 'scienza', 'ragione']",moltimondi

He would later revise those words, replacing them with ""All genius, all buffoon.""

363,Richard Feynman - Can Machines Think?,359,5,0,2,2021-02-20T11:30:18Z,536.0,en,"Ave, Coders!
 
There are questions that we as Humanity still cannot find definite answers to, questions that were challenging many generations of writers, scientists, philosophers, and when we think we’ve found a reasonable answer, very soon we begin to doubt it. 
 
But I wonder, what if we could ask those bright minds about their thoughts on resolving those questions and how did they get to their answers? Unfortunately, we still don't have a time machine to ask them these questions personally but we have other artifacts such as books, films and, more recently, the Internet. 
 
Thanks to the latter, we have a chance to pretend to travel back in time and challenge the great minds of their time with these questions.
Specifically, we can travel to the  26th of September of 1985 and ask a famous scientist Richard Feynman: “Do you think there will ever be a machine that will think like human beings and be more intelligent than human beings?”

367,File your Income Tax with physicist Richard Feynman I Love Letter I By The Window I Saturday Stroll,303,18,0,10,2023-03-19T04:45:01Z,96.0,,"Richard Feynman was an amazing character mastering physics, thinking, life, and as we shall soon see, love. Richard and Arline Greenbaum were soul mates. They were a perfect symbiotic pair, each completing the other. They shared the love we all seek.
Feynman was fond of writing love letters to Arline. Many of them appear in Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track.

None is more beautiful than the one Richard wrote to Arline sixteen months after her death.


October 17, 1946

D’Arline,

I adore you, sweetheart.

I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.

It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.

But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.

I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the “idea-woman” and general instigator of all our wild adventures.

When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.

I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.

My darling wife, I do adore you.

I love my wife. My wife is dead.

Rich.

GENIUS RICHARD FEYNMAN: LA VIDA, EL UNIVERSO Y TODO
Un genio excéntrico, entre las flores, música, maestro carismático, divertido , irreverente, el genio que resolvía ecuaciones complejas de la física en bares de striptease. La curiosidad científica de Richard Feynman no conocía límites.🌏

En pocas palabras, uno de los científicos más extraordinarios del siglo XX. Fue uno de los grandes científicos y físicos de nuestro tiempo, verdaderamente una de las grandes mentes de la humanidad. A continuación, recogemos gran parte de su sabiduría en un solo lugar

""El primer principio es que no debes engañarte a ti mismo, y eres la persona más fácil de engañar"" 🌏🌕

El método de pensamiento Feynmann fue desarrollado por un hombre que rechazó la sabiduría convencional a cualquier paso y que buscó construir su computadora mental desde cero.
Así fue como Feynman abordó todo el conocimiento: ¿Qué puedo saber con certeza y cómo puedo llegar a conocerlo?
Cuando Feynman se enfrenta a un problema, es inusualmente bueno para volver a ser como un niño, ignorando lo que todos los demás piensan . Estaba tan desatascado: si algo no funcionaba, lo miraba de otra manera

Lo que tomamos de Feynman es una búsqueda absoluta e invariable de la racionalidad y la verdad. Feynman preferiría admitir que no sabía algo que creer en el conocimiento falso

Feynman nunca se conformó con conocer la descripción de las cosas o las verdades aceptadas de las cosas. En cambio, realmente quería saber, y fue esa curiosidad ardiente la que lo llevó a su mayor trabajo. Feynman era humano, a veces demasiado humano, pero su mente estaba dedicada a descubrir la realidad de la manera en que era.

Richard Feynman gives us a lecture on Quantum electrodynamcis, the theory of photons and electron interactions which incorporates his unique view of the fundamental processes that create it. one of the 3 winners of the 1965 Nobel prize in Physics for his work, Feynman is was an expert on quantum mechanics and developed the Path Integral formulation of Relativistic Quantum mechanics, used in Quantum Field Theory, interpreted the Born series of scattering amplitudes as vertices and Green's function propagators in his famous diagrams, the Feynman Diagrams, and also worked on the fundamental excitations in Liquid Helium leading to a correct model describing superfluidity using phonons, maxons and rotons to describe the various excitation curves. 
other fields of work include the Feynman-Hellmann Theorem, which can relate the derivative of the total energy of any system to the expectation value of the derivative of the Hamiltonian under a single parameter, e.g volume. 
he also worked on the Rogers Commission report during the investigation of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where Feynman famously demonstrated how the Booster Rocket O-rings, which are elastic sealing joints, became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water- his high intelligence and independant way of looking at the world often made him ""a real pain"" in the eyes of other, less skilled, Commission members. 
Feynman's own investigation reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts, such as safety proceedures. 
Although Feynman got plenty of media coverage due to him being on the Commission, he was often told to stay quiet about NASA's more sinister secrets and tactics in space exploration.","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Quantum', 'electrodynamics', 'Field', 'Theory', 'Mechanics', 'photons', 'electrons', 'electromagnetism', 'nuclear', 'forces', 'fundamental', 'physics', 'lectures', 'QED', 'elementary', 'particles', 'chemistry', 'math', 'technology', 'space', 'experiment', 'electronics']",Muon Ray

384,Richard Feynman on knowing things.,168,13,0,1,2021-03-27T20:11:58Z,54.0,en,"“I don't feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell. Possibly. It doesn't frighten me.”

― Richard P. Feynman 
“Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.”
“Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.”
“You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.”
― Richard P. Feynman, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character
“Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it.”
“I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimetre; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colours in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate is interesting; it means that insects can see the colour. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.”
― Richard P. Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: The Best Short Works of Richard P. Feynman
“I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”
“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”
“Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.”

Richard Feynman Kimdir
20. yüzyılın en önemli fizikçilerindendir. Kuantum elektrodinamiği üzerindeki çalışmaları nedeniyle 1965'te Julian Schwinger ve Sin-Itiro Tomonaga ile beraber Nobel Fizik Ödülüne layık görülmüştür.1918'de ABD'nin New York eyaletinde Queens'teki Far Rockway adlı küçük bir kasabada dünyaya geldi. Henüz 16 yaşındayken türev ve integral hesabını tüm yönleriyle kavradı. 17 yaşında Rockway'den ayrılıp, lisans derecesini yapacağı MIT 'e girdi. Lisans derecesinden sonra ünlü Princeton Üniversitesi'ne kabul edildi. Doktorasını Princeton'dan aldıktan sonra, dekorsal sanatlar öğretmeni Arline Greenbaum ile ailesinin itirazlarına aldırış etmeyerek evlendi. 1942'de ABD'nin savaşa katılmasıyla birlikte, Manhattan Projesi (atom bombası projesi) için çağrıldı.
Burada Nazilerden kaçıp ABD'ye sığınan, Alman fizikçi Hans Bethe tarafından kuramsal bölümün önderi olarak atandı. Bu görevi aldığında henüz 24 yaşındaydı. Manhattan Projesi'nde Feynman, kritik kütle için gerekli olan uranyum miktarını tespit etmek için çalıştı. Hipotezini denemek için Los Alamos'u havaya uçurmadan birçok deney araçları geliştirdi. Oak Ridge uranyumun parçalanması sırasında güvenlik sorunuyla uğraşırken, Feynman çalışanların ışıma zehirlenmesinden korunması için prosedürler geliştirdi. Savaş sonrası Bethe'yi takip ederek, Cornell Üniversitesi'ne gitti. Feynman burada atomaltı parçacıkların karmaşık yapısı için basit bir gösterim geliştirdi. Onun bu gösterimi Feynman Çizelgeleri olarak bilinir.

Savaş bittikten sonra, 1965'te Kuantum elektrodinamiğine yaptığı katkılardan dolayı Itiro Tomonaga ve Julian Schwinger ile birlikte Nobel Ödülüne layık görüldü. 1986'daki Challenger felaketini araştıran Rogers komisyonunda yer aldı.
1988'de Los Angeles'ta öldü.

En este vídeo te voy a explicar la técnica de estudio utilizada por el afamado físico Richard Feynman, para que también puedas aplicarla durante tus sesiones de estudio tanto si estás en secundaria como en la universidad.

*** PASO 1 ***
Hacer una lectura del tema en cuestión y, a continuación, redactar un resumen, como si quisiéramos dar una clase o una ponencia. Y, preferiblemente, lo explicamos de viva voz como si nos encontrásemos ante toda una clase o auditorio.
De esta forma serás perfectamente consciente de aquellas cosas que no te han quedado claras aún.

*** PASO 2 ***
Repite el paso anterior hasta que veas que toda la ""exposición"" sale sin fallos.

*** PASO 3 ***
Una vez listo, repite la exposición (y también tu resumen) pero simplificando tu discurso y añadiendo analogías o dibujos que hagan la información más sencilla y visual. En el caso de que veas que tu explicación es demasiado compleja, hay que volver a comenzar.

*** CONCLUSIONES ***
El tener que forzarnos a pensar en una idea concreta, y no sólo en memorizarla, hace que resulte mucho más sencillo el llegar a comprenderla.

396,The Role of Interpretation in Physics (Richard Feynman),383,15,0,0,2019-12-26T10:12:34Z,51.0,en,"In 1963 Richard Feynman was invited to give the 1964 Messenger Lectures at Cornell University, an annual tradition since 1924, when Hiram Messenger gifted Cornell with ""a fund to provide a course of lectures on the Evolution of Civilization for the special purpose of raising the moral standard of our political, business, and social life"", to be ""delivered by the ablest non-resident lecturer or lecturers obtainable"".

Feynman had been a physics professor at Cornell from 1945 to 1950, during which time he did the work for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1965. While at Cornell Feynman became well-known in the physics community for his innovations in quantum electrodynamics and idosyncratic style. He was at Caltech in 1963, when he was invited to become the 41st Messenger Lecturer1, by which time he had become known to a much wider audience through his recently published book, Volume I of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.2

According to the Cornell Faculty Website, ""A Messenger Lecturer typically gives three lectures/presentations over the course of a one-week visit. At least one of these must be a lecture that is suitable for a general audience.""3 Feynman, however, chose to give a series of six lectures, all for a general audience, which he titled The Character of Physical Law.4 He had plenty of material to draw from his recently completed introductory physics course, the basis of The Feynman Lectures on Physics. For this reason one finds many similarities, parallels, and even identical parts in the lectures of The Character of Physical Law and several of the lectures in The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

Feynman's Messenger Lectures were videotaped by the BBC, who in 1965 published a hardbound book of edited lecture transcripts under the title, The Character of Physical Law. In 1967 the paperback rights were licensed to MIT Press who continues to print the book today.5 The videotapes were transferred to film, and in the late 1960s through the '70s copies of the films were in wide distribution at colleges and universities.6 Sadly, however, these wonderful films of Feynman lecturing at the peak of his prowess went out of distribution and became generally unavailable in the 1980s.

In 2009, when Microsoft Research introduced their Silverlight framework for media-rich web applications, Bill Gates licensed rights to stream the BBC's films of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures online. Hoping to encourage others to make educational content available for free, he used them in the first Silverlight demo, “Project Tuva.”7 The publication of Feynman’s Messenger Lectures for free online viewing, with special features such as searchable synchronized scrolling transcripts, links to related online material, and commentary, was an instant hit with Feynman fans, students and physicists. The Silverlight framework, however, was not widely adopted, and in 2016 Project Tuva was retired. The videos were still available for viewing on the Microsoft Research Website (though without the special features) until 2021, when their BBC license expired. The license has since been generously renewed by Bill Gates so that the videos can continue to be shown online to users of The Feynman Lectures Website.","['Richard Feynman', 'Interpretation', 'quantum mechanics']",EISM

Richard Feynman gives us a lecture on Quantum electrodynamcis, the theory of photons and electron interactions which incorporates his unique view of the fundamental processes that create it. one of the 3 winners of the 1965 Nobel prize in Physics for his work, Feynman is was an expert on quantum mechanics and developed the Path Integral formulation of Relativistic Quantum mechanics, used in Quantum Field Theory, interpreted the Born series of scattering amplitudes as vertices and Green's function propagators in his famous diagrams, the Feynman Diagrams, and also worked on the fundamental excitations in Liquid Helium leading to a correct model describing superfluidity using phonons, maxons and rotons to describe the various excitation curves. 
other fields of work include the Feynman-Hellmann Theorem, which can relate the derivative of the total energy of any system to the expectation value of the derivative of the Hamiltonian under a single parameter, e.g volume. 
he also worked on the Rogers Commission report during the investigation of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where Feynman famously demonstrated how the Booster Rocket O-rings, which are elastic sealing joints, became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water- his high intelligence and independant way of looking at the world often made him ""a real pain"" in the eyes of other, less skilled, Commission members. 
Feynman's own investigation reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts, such as safety proceedures. 
Although Feynman got plenty of media coverage due to him being on the Commission, he was often told to stay quiet about NASA's more sinister secrets and tactics in space exploration.","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Quantum', 'electrodynamics', 'Field', 'Theory', 'Mechanics', 'photons', 'electrons', 'electromagnetism', 'nuclear', 'forces', 'fundamental', 'physics', 'lectures', 'QED', 'elementary', 'particles', 'chemistry']",Muon Ray

Richard Phillips Feynman was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.

Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.

Pour sortir un peu du monde du business, Olivier Roland décide de nous présenter dans cette vidéo un livre autobiographique de Richard Feynman intitulé « Vous voulez rire, monsieur Feynman ».

Brillant physicien, professeur, adepte de tambours, passionné de cryptographie et grand séducteur, Richard Feynman nous retranscrit en détail les évènements marquants de sa vie. Richard Feynman est une personne très ouverte intellectuellement avec un charisme incroyable avec un grand esprit d’aventurier. Bref, une personne qui savait ce qu’il faisait.

Le bouquin est une autobiographie assez drôle d’un génie. D’où le titre « Vous voulez rire monsieur Feynman ? ». Et à travers ce livre, l’auteur nous fait découvrir ce que c’est de vivre dans une société où tout le monde paraît moins intelligent que vous. En d’autres termes d’être un génie parmi tant d’autres personnes. C’est un livre très passionnant, facile à lire et surtout très enrichissant. D’autant plus que dans ce livre l’on voit de tout : science, séduction, musique…

La lecture de ce livre vous est vraiment conseillée, car il vous donnera l’occasion de rentrer dans l’état d’esprit d’un vrai génie. Une expérience incroyable qui sera loin de vous déplaire.

Richard Feynman gives us a lecture on Quantum electrodynamcis, the theory of photons and electron interactions which incorporates his unique view of the fundamental processes that create it. one of the 3 winners of the 1965 Nobel prize in Physics for his work, Feynman is was an expert on quantum mechanics and developed the Path Integral formulation of Relativistic Quantum mechanics, used in Quantum Field Theory, interpreted the Born series of scattering amplitudes as vertices and Green's function propagators in his famous diagrams, the Feynman Diagrams, and also worked on the fundamental excitations in Liquid Helium leading to a correct model describing superfluidity using phonons, maxons and rotons to describe the various excitation curves. 
other fields of work include the Feynman-Hellmann Theorem, which can relate the derivative of the total energy of any system to the expectation value of the derivative of the Hamiltonian under a single parameter, e.g volume. 
he also worked on the Rogers Commission report during the investigation of the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where Feynman famously demonstrated how the Booster Rocket O-rings, which are elastic sealing joints, became less resilient and subject to seal failures at ice-cold temperatures by immersing a sample of the material in a glass of ice water- his high intelligence and independant way of looking at the world often made him ""a real pain"" in the eyes of other, less skilled, Commission members. 
Feynman's own investigation reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts, such as safety proceedures. 
Although Feynman got plenty of media coverage due to him being on the Commission, he was often told to stay quiet about NASA's more sinister secrets and tactics in space exploration.","['Richard', 'Feynman', 'Quantum', 'electrodynamics', 'Field', 'Theory', 'Mechanics', 'photons', 'electrons', 'electromagnetism', 'nuclear', 'forces', 'fundamental', 'physics', 'lectures', 'QED', 'elementary', 'particles', 'chemistry']",Muon Ray

Pick a Topic you wish to start studying for.
Once you get to know what it is, write about it on a piece of paper.
Write as if you are the teacher and teaching the topic to someone else.
Factually, you speak and write at the same time.
When a teacher is writing something on the blackboard, he himself is writing and speaking at the same time.
This helps him demonstrate correctly.
While doing that, you will realize which of the concepts are getting cleared and where you still require more effort.
When you find out where you require more effort, get back to studying it once again, and repeat the procedure until you have explained everything from start to end.
Once you have explained the whole topic, repeat the whole process from the beginning but this time adopt an even more simple language.
If your explanation is to the point and understandable then you have succeeded.
However, if the explanation is confusing and wordy, you yourself have not understood the topic well enough.
“Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.”
“Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.”
“You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.”
― Richard P. Feynman, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character
“Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it.”
“I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimetre; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colours in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate is interesting; it means that insects can see the colour. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.”
― Richard P. Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: The Best Short Works of Richard P. Feynman
“I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”
“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”
“Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.”

Richard Feynman explains the Scientific Method.
Richard Phillips Feynman (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga.

Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.

He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.",,Atmos

Born in New York City, Feynman's charismatic and unconventional approach to physics made him a unique figure in the scientific community.

Feynman's work was instrumental in the development of the field of quantum electrodynamics, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965, along with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. His Feynman diagrams, graphical representations of particle interactions, have become iconic in the world of theoretical physics.

Beyond his academic achievements, Feynman was renowned for his engaging teaching style and ability to convey complex scientific concepts with clarity and humor. His lectures, including the famous ""Feynman Lectures on Physics,"" have inspired generations of students and enthusiasts.

Feynman's intellectual curiosity extended beyond physics, and he was an accomplished bongo player and artist. His autobiographical works, such as ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"" and ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?,"" provide insights into his personality, adventures, and the joy he found in exploring the wonders of the universe.

Vậy làm thế nào để có thể nhanh chóng nắm bắt các xu hướng mới, công nghệ mới và áp dụng chúng vào công việc? Câu trả lời nằm ở Phương Pháp Feynman.

Trong video này, Thành sẽ giới thiệu chi tiết về phương pháp học tập hiệu quả do chính nhà vật lý lừng danh Richard Feynman phát triển. Phương pháp Feynman là một kỹ thuật độc đáo giúp bạn nắm bắt nhanh chóng bất kỳ khái niệm phức tạp nào bằng cách yêu cầu bạn giải thích lại cho người khác.

Qua 4 bước cơ bản: Chọn khái niệm, Giải thích cho người khác, Xác định khoảng trống kiến thức, Ôn tập và đơn giản hóa, phương pháp Feynman sẽ giúp bạn nắm chắc kiến thức, phát triển tư duy logic và khả năng diễn đạt.

Áp dụng phương pháp này, bạn sẽ đạt được những lợi ích sau:

Hiểu sâu hơn các khái niệm, nguyên lý
Ghi nhớ kiến thức lâu dài
Phân tích vấn đề một cách logic, sáng tạo
Khả năng diễn đạt rõ ràng, mạch lạc
Tự tin truyền đạt ý tưởng, kiến thức
Cập nhật nhanh chóng các xu hướng mới
Nâng cao năng lực ứng phó với thay đổi
Chính vì thế, phương pháp Feynman là một kỹ năng vô cùng quan trọng cho các doanh nhân, lãnh đạo trong thời đại kinh doanh hiện nay.
Áp dụng phương pháp này, bạn sẽ có ""chìa khoá"" để dẫn dắt doanh nghiệp tiến vào tương lai, không bị bỏ lại phía sau bởi sự phát triển của trí tuệ nhân tạo.

Hãy xem ngay video của Thành để nắm rõ cách áp dụng phương pháp Feynman, nâng cao năng lực bản thân và dẫn dắt doanh nghiệp phát triển mạnh mẽ. Đừng bỏ lỡ cơ hội nâng tầm bản thân với kỹ năng học tập hiệu quả này!

Many argue that string theory cannot be proven and should therefore be abandoned. For them, string theory is not science at all. But are they right?

Here to discuss these claims with me is none other than Cumrun Vafa! Cumrun is the Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in the Department of Physics at Harvard University, where he has been researching and teaching theoretical physics since 1985. His primary area of research is string theory. 

In our interview, we discussed why we should trust String Theory, Fine Tuning, and the message he'd put into a billion-year time capsule. We also talked about his recently released book Puzzles to Unravel the Universe.

Das Ende von ALLEM???

Gibt es das Ende der periodischen Tabelle der Elemente? Das letzte uns bekannte chemische Element heißt ""Oganesson"" und hat Nummer 118, es wurde 2002 im Labor in Dubna, Russland synthetisiert. Gibt es aber eine fundamentale Grenze, nach der es überhaupt nicht möglich ist, neue Elemente zu bekommen?

Richard Feynman hat mal gesagt, dass Element 137 das letzte element im Periodensystem sein wird. Warum hat er das gesagt und stimmt das wirklich?

493,"I will teach you Physics and maths at 9th,10th,11th , and 12th CBSE in Loni Block D... - Saurabh Jha",5,0,0,0,2023-11-20T15:00:43Z,104.0,,"I am a teacher and a person who have lots of curiosity to understand things and make the things simple for others. I am from Delhi, having B.Sc. in Physics and right now I am doing my another bachelor in German language from St. Stephens' college, university of Delhi. I love teaching and can make good connection with students, and  help them to understand challenging topics in physics and mathematics in simple way by giving proper examples. I have experience more than  4 years of teaching (offline + online). 
I provide 9th,10th,11th,12th tuition for physics and mathematics one to one online.

Methodology

""If you find science boring, you're learning it from a wrong teacher! ""
-Richard Feynman

""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"".
-Albert Einstein  

From past couple of  years ,  while teaching, I have  understand two main things.
First: - A concept is easy only if you understand how the things get define,  And that can only be understand by asking questions. 
For example :- Many times I have taught trigonometry to my student's. 
One day a student asks me ""Sir why trigonometry ratios are only six (sin, cos, tan, COSEC, sec, cot) why not seven, eight or five""???
Maybe you're thinking this is a fact, so i think it's a illogical question, or maybe you think it's a simple question but according to me, ""it's a perfect question to understand trigonometry deeply"". Don't you get worry about this thing we  will definitely gonna  discuss this question deeply in our class.

Second thing :- Every student is perfect in their own way, and maybe they have lots of curiosity to understand the things. But the problem is that teacher thinks that student comes at their level of understanding the concepts ,  but according to me the process should be reverse. A teacher needs to understand the level of the student and should make concept clear  to them.

So , if you want to dive deep  into the pool of  understanding the real world by the help of physics and mathematics . 
Then you come at right place , i can help you in understanding the concept very well. 

Always remember one thing "" choose your teacher wisely "" .

Today we’re going to talk about the names in Full Metal Jacket.  This is part of my effort to do a meta analysis of Stanley Kubrick’s entire body of work.  Everything is everything, and the exit signs lead everywhere.  I’m focusing on the characters in the first part of Full metal Jacket; Sgt. Hartman, Joker, Pyle, Cowboy and Pvt. Snowball.  But also EIghtball from the second half of the movie.  I will ask “What are the odds?” Several times here.  But, it’s time everybody. So fire up the percolator!!!

Did I say anything?  Let me know.  And of course…

Stay tuned!!!

The rapid evolution of technology has led to transformative changes in our society, particularly in the fields of programming, Quantum Computing, and artificial intelligence.

生活的真相和财富的真相，往往并不好听。从小听的童话故事，“从此过上了幸福的生活Happily ever after”，成年之后才知道是一个彻头彻尾的谎言。

成长和生活中的总结的真理往往也是伴随痛苦的，回想一下，你曾经人生中的关键决定，成长最快速的阶段，都是痛定思痛，生理和心理走出舒适区最不适应的时候。

因为快速成长和打工人几年里营造的舒适区，理念是完全相悖的。著名经济学家John Stuart Mill是这样总结打工阶级的本性的：其实就是“我们徒劳的作为工人阶级，在劳动和所谓优秀的工作当中寻找自尊，但在绝大多数情况下，单方面自我感动的努力，和舒适区当中的付出，来去回报自己在舒适区中不作出改变的懒惰。

所以今天这期视频，都是一些不好听的生活的真相，这些harsh truth你也许并不想听，A little bit dark and harsh truth that you may not wanna hear但在成长和积累财富的角度，却可以让你创造收入，创造超越阶级的收入，同时不失生活中原有的简单与幸福感。
这五个让人痛彻心扉的真相，其实也是像Mark Manson, Alex Hormozi, Peter Thiel, Naval Ravikant 这类大佬们，经历了几年痛苦，几次资产清盘、复盘才总结出的人生真相。在2023年快结束的时候送给你。

第一章 继续抱怨________，你就会继续一生都是Loser
第二章  _______是一种社会技能，却能毁掉你的幸福感
第三章 每一个你珍惜的________，有一天都会让你失望
第四章 好人有好报，我“本应”幸福的谬论
第五章 自我暗示下_______的复利会毁了你的一生

0:00 开篇
2:37 目录
4:09 继续抱怨，继续Loser
7:56 黑猩猩实验
9:08 有关judging和判断力的真相
